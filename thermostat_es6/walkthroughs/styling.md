# Walkthrough - Thermostat: styling

[Back to the Challenge](../styling.md)

#### Questions you will want to answer

- What needs to be an image?
- What needs to be grouped with what?
- What are the smallest amount of containers I can use?
- Am I going full width or taking up just a portion of the viewport?
- Does this need to be responsive?
- Will I need to use external fonts or system fonts?
- Are there interactive parts that will need styles I canâ€™t necessarily see from a static mockup?
- Do I need to vertically center anything?

#### Other considerations

- Tools to make this easier? (pixel rules, libraries, Chrome Dev Tools)
- Playing with CSS in Dev Tools !important
- Live reload
- User agent stylesheet
- Learning how to read specificity
- CSS reset
- Grouping rules
