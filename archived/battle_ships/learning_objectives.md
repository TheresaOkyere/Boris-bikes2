##Learning Objectives: Battleships

*Learning Objectives are organised by topic, and then by subtopic. As you go down the bullet-point list below each subtopic header, skills become more advanced/involved.*

In general this week should consolidate all of the learning objectives from week 1 and the student should be able to apply all of them to an Object-Oriented system of intermediate complexity.

# Design and Practice

## Domain Model and Minimum Viable Product (MVP)/prototype (MVp)

* Explain what an MVP is and why it is a useful development construct
* Differentiate between MVP and MVp
* Use CRC cards to help develop a model
* Create a domain model of intermediate complexity
* Select which part of a domain model to implement to support an MVP
* Create Minimum Viable Prototypes (MVps)
* Construct an MVP using MVps, via BDD/TDD

## Inheritance vs Composition

* Define Inheritance
* Define Composition
* Differentiate between Inheritance and Composition in an OO system
* Use both inheritance and composition in OO design

## Encapsulation
* Define Encapsulation
* Explain why encapsulation is useful
* Assess appropriate use of encapsulation within an OO system
* Develop an appropriately encapsulated OO system

## Polymorphism
* Define Polymorphism (in Ruby) as being able to send the same message to different objects and get different results
* Give an example of Polymorphism in Ruby [[Thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/back-to-basics-polymorphism-and-ruby) (reading)]

# UX/UI Design

* Define UX design as User Experience design
* Define UI design as User Interface design
* Explain what UX and UI are
* Link UX and UI design processes
* Link UX and UI design processes with the development process
* Discuss some challenges involved in UX and UI design

# Object-Oriented Programming
## Principles
* Be aware of the O, L, and I components for more detailed study in subsequent weeks

## S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* Paraphrase the SRP
* Explain how SRP makes for more maintainable systems
* Discuss the SRP's importance in development

## D - Dependency Inversion Principle
* Define a dependency in OOD
* Explain why minimising dependencies is good for code maintainability
* Use Dependency Injection to minimise dependencies
* Use Dependency Inversion to minimise dependencies

# Ruby

## Blocks, Procs & Lambdas

* Define blocks, `Proc`s, and `lambda`s as anonymous functions in Ruby
* Differentiate between blocks, `Proc`s, and `lambda`s
* Use blocks, `Proc`s, and `lambda`s in iterators (e.g. `map`, `inject`, etc.)
* Implement a method using a block
* Pass `Proc`s and `lambda`s as arguments
* Construct tests using `Proc`s and `lambda`s (e.g `expect { x }.to raise_error`)

## Class Methods

* Remember that a class method can be called directly on a class, without class instantiation
* Define a class method in Ruby
* Decide when to use class methods
* Use a class method to get rid of "magic numbers" from code
* Use a class method to make instantiation of an object more readable

## Gems

* Define a Gem as a Ruby package or library
* Explain how gems are used in Ruby
* Give several places to find and discover gems
* Explain how a Gemfile and Bundler are used to control gem dependencies in a project
* Explain how the `Gemfile.lock` file ensures consistent use of libraries
* Use a Gemfile and Bundler to control gems for a project

# Technologies

## APIs
* Define an API as an Application Program Interface
* Give ways in which APIs are used in programming
* Diagram how a program might use an online API


Weekly Challenge
===========

## Inject

**Topics covered**

* Comprehensive understanding of the `yield` method
* Comprehensive understanding of Ruby styles such as inject
* Test driven development (TDD)


## TakeAway

**Topics covered**

* Use of Gems and APIs
* Ability to effectively mock 3rd party APIs in order to avoid test suites being bad net citizens
* Further OOD and OOP practice
