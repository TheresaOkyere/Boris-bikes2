# Working from home

You will need:

- your laptop and charger

- a good internet connection
- headphones with a microphone :headphones:

## Set up your working space

Having a dedicated working area/spot at home is important to set healthy boundaries between work and home life when working remotely for an extended period of time.

**Somewhere to work**
  - Comfortable seat
  - Table or desk
  - Headphones with microphone

**Somewhere to take breaks**
  - Space to prepare drinks and eat meals
  - Your favourite forms of entertainment

## Establish boundaries

Let everyone you live with know where and when you'll be working from home.

Ask them to avoid distracting you when you're working. And ask them to remind you not to overwork.
