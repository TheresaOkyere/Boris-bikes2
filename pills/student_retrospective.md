# Student retrospectives

At the end of many weeks, your coach will run a retrospective (retro).

## Process

Time: 30 minutes.

* You assemble on chairs facing a whiteboard.

* The coach writes two headings: successes and struggles.

* For five minutes, you write things under these headings.  e.g. "Making debugging process more rigorous".

* If someone has already written something that you felt, put a `+` next to it.

* The coach picks out a few items to discuss.

* The whole group discusses each item, with light facilitation from the coach.

* As the discussion progresses, the coach notes down important points raised and suggestions for improvement.

* The coach posts photos of the whiteboard on Slack for you to reflect on.

## Why retrospectives?

* They let you reflect on and think of improvements to your learning and developer processes.
* They let your coach gently guide you towards ways to improve your learning and developer skills.
