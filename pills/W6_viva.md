## W6 Review at Makers

Hi! You've found info on the W6 Review! Congrats!

Join `#Reviews` on slack for a place to ask more questions or get more info!
_Here's a link to the instructions doc with useful information for the end of course Review https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w4uywH24Q68ffHi-WTcQhaHwyknMIQ9WLpOLTAS1czk/edit_

There are 3 main reasons for having a smaller Review halfway through the course.

1. Feedback from students indicated that it was tough to start and finish aportfolio all at the end of the course - so spreading this reflective work over the course makes sense, and has the advantage that it should push you even more to think of your goals when you're prioritising what to learn.

2. By starting the portfolio early and then practicing a Review, you're more likely to be confident and practiced for the Review you'll take when you feel you've achieved the course goals.

3. You are responsible for having an answer to the question 'Am I on track to passing my Review at the end of the course?' The W6 Review should be a high-quality data point you can use to assess and/or improve your learning process.

**NB** It's run entirely by the coaching team - it's only about helping you improve your learning process. It's **not a pass/fail test.** If it feels like one, please let us know this.

We'll only focus on 5 goals:

- I grow collaboratively
- I can TDD anything
- I can model anything
- I have a methodical approach to solving problems
- I can learn anything by myself

#### How long will they be?
They'll be 15 mins each, with 5 mins for feedback.

#### Who will be on the panel?
One, maybe two coaches.

#### Will I pass or fail it?
Nope - the only outcome for everyone is feedback for the evidences you've collected to demonstrate achieving the goals - this will help you assess how you're doing.

#### How do I book my W6 Review?
1. During the week before, a coach will send out a google spreadsheet where you will book a slot.
2. In order to book a slot add your name and a link to yourportfolio doc.
3. A coach will confirm on the day where they will be.

#### Where is theportfolio document I should fill out?
In the #Reviews channel topic you’ll see a link to important instructions - make sure you've read the pre-requisites.

Follow the instructions to make a copy of theportfolio doc, and browse the archive to have a sense of how to fill out the form. Make sure you understand the types of evidence - weak, moderate, and strong evidences.

#### How much of theportfolio doc I should fill out?
We’re looking for you to have reflected on what evidence you need, and then gathered it to show to yourself you’re on track to achieving the 5 goals in particular (but the more the better, really!).

#### When should I submit myportfolio?
Ideally the coaching team would like to be able to read the theses in the morning beforehand. So the night beforehand it should be up-to-date for us!

#### Can I book a slot without having myportfolio 'ready'?
Absolutely - if not very much encouraged! We'll only read it that day.

#### I have not been tracking my reflection towards learning goals, does that matter a lot?
Yes - the reflection on each bit of work that you do towards a learning goal is really important.

Ideally you would
- reflect on each of the goals, and match them up with the themes of the course - so you have an idea of when to be focusing on what.
- Then you would think of a set of evidences that would show you've achieved the goal.
- Then you would start work gathering the first evidence
- Then reflection on it to understand what the next gap to focus on is.

#### Will you appreciate honesty over confidence? - i.e. if I'm not confident in a particular aspect should I treat it like an interview or be honest?
Remember - this is entirely and only for your benefit - so the more honest you are, the more likely you are to get feedback that will help you learn and know what to focus on.

#### What is it like?
It's a discussion! You'll chat with a coach about the evidences you have, and what more you are planning to gather to show to yourself you can achieve a course goal.

#### What do you mean by 'anything'?
It's intentionally vague and aspirational - it's your job to do some reflective work and think about what would a set of evidences look like that's focused not on being an expert, but that gives you confidence that with time you can achieve the goals.

#### What if I haven't received much coach feedback yet, and I'm unlikely to do so?
Don't worry about it for now. If you can, please hold us to account - we should be trying to give you feedback to help you self-assess and improve. If we're not giving useful feedback relatively quickly, we need to do better.


#### Are we expected to say yes to any of the goals yet?
Not necessarily - but you are expected to have an idea of what a strong set of evidences looks like for each of the 5 goals.

#### Can we use feedback from the mock as empirical evidence?
Yes

#### I still have questions about this!
Find a member of the coaching team and ask!
