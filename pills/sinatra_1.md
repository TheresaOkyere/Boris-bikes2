# Sinatra

[Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) is a simple, no-frills web application framework for Ruby. It allows you to integrate applications written in Ruby with a web interface, so anyone with a browser can use them. In contrast to more complex web application frameworks such as [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org), Sinatra provides very little beyond making your ruby code accessible to requests that come over the HTTP protocol.

> Sinatra is one of many simple web application frameworks.  You can read about some of the alternatives in [this blog post](http://www.sitepoint.com/ruby-microframeworks-round/).


As with every pill and project please do type in the code examples instead of copy-pasting them, it will help you to memorise and understand what you're doing.

## What you will learn

* How to set-up and use Sinatra
* Routes
* Templates
* Forms
* Parameters

## Prerequisites

You should be fully proficient in Ruby (post-precourse standard), including [blocks&nbsp;:pill:](blocks.md). For later parts of this walkthrough, you will also need to be proficient with [HTML&nbsp;:pill:](html.md) and [CSS&nbsp;:pill:](css.md).

## Sinatra Installation

***Note, we recommend working through this pill with a pair partner. Please take turns on the keyboard as the driver as described in the [pairing pill&nbsp;:pill:](pairing.md).***

As with every bit of non-trivial code you write it's a good idea to initialise a git repository and push your code to Github in order to back it up.  Put the following code in a Github repo called `sinatra-test`.

As mentioned above, Sinatra is just a Ruby [gem](gems.md) :pill:, so you'll need to install it as usual:

`$ gem install sinatra`

> Where does this install the Sinatra gem?

However, a better way would be to put it in your Gemfile:

```ruby
# Gemfile
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'sinatra'
```

and install using [bundler](bundler.md) :pill::

`$ bundle install`

In this way you'll be keeping a record of what gems are used in the project for other developers to see. This is important when there are hundreds!

Once you have installed Sinatra, you are ready to create a web-accessible _Hello World_ application. Let's do that now.
