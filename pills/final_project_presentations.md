# Final Project Presentations

Here are some guidelines for your final project presentations:

* The time limit is usually 5-7 minutes (this depends on the number of projects, your coach will advise if the time limit is different).  Practice, practice, practice to ensure you come in under the time limit.  You'll be prompted to wind up your presentations after this time limit!

* Everyone in your team has contributed to the projects so everyone should speak in the presentation, if they are comfortable doing so.

* To guide you on what to include, think about what you found interesting about other people’s presentations.

* If appropriate, make it funny. If not, make it engaging.

* Explain very briefly a scenario where someone might use your project. What problem does it solve?

* Make a video that demonstrates a user using your project.  One of your team can describe what's going on as the video plays.  Please use this video instead of a live demo (every time I've done a live demo, at least one thing has gone wrong). You can use [Quicktime](https://support.apple.com/kb/ph5882?locale=en_US) (built-in to MacOS) to record your screen.

* Describe your learning journey through this project. What did you start with. What did you learn and how? What were the lows and how did you overcome them. Focus on behaviours and skills. Be specific. Don't say, "we communicated well". Say, "We had a miscommunication where two pairs worked on the same feature. We decided in the future to..."

* No need to be overly technical. You can keep the detailed explanations for the project fair when people will come chat with you. The audience is mainly non-technical and they should be able to understand your description.
Instead, you can talk about the main part of the project and maybe how information flows through it. Don't put up the _Wall of Death_ (the slide that is just library and framework logos).

* There's no need to talk about the future direction of the project.  Focus your presentation on what you've already achieved.
