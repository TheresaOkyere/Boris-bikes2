# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

:construction: UNDER CONSTRUCTION :construction:

**OOP** is a style of programming that encourages us to break code up into 'objects'. This 'modularization' leaves our code flexible, anticipating future changes.  Changes are guaranteed as a project progresses: inevitably, we will discover that end users derive more value from something different than what we have built so far. While we cannot plan for the specific changes they will require (because we don't know them yet!), OOP encourages us to write code that is easy to change in any circumstance.
