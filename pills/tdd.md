# Test Driven Development (TDD)

[Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) is a development practice that involves writing tests before writing the code that's being tested. In practice you begin by writing a small test for code that does not exist yet. You then run the test, seeing it fail. Then you proceed to write just enough code to make the test pass.

  **Only write the simplest code that will make the test pass, not more!**

Once your test is passing take a look at the code you just wrote and [refactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring)  it to clean it up. This is the point where most people struggle with this practice. The resulting code, specially if you have *really* written only the simplest thing that could possibly work, looks to simplistic and rather *stupid*. Don't worry about that at this time, we are trying to move forward with *baby steps*.

The most challenging part of any software project is, if you think about it, the acquisition of knowledge. Assuming you know how to write software in the first place, but once you do, it is really only a matter of understanding the problem you are trying to solve.

A few folks in the agile community realised this a while ago and they found out that while they were driving their code with [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)  they could make design decisions on the fly (*more or less*). This lead into a practice called [Emergent Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_Design#Emergent_design_in_agile_software_development) (You definitely should read a little more about this and other practices in your own accord at some point).
