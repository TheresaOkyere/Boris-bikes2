AngularJS
=========

Angular is a front-end MVC framework designed to build web applications rather than just static HTML pages. As the web has matured people have started asking for more from websites - we've seen this with the ubiquitous use of jQuery on almost every webpage you visit. As people have started putting more and more logic into the front-end, the size and complexity of front-end applications has grown. Angular attempts to alleviate some of the problems associated with large front-end applications, and also provides some tools to help you write and test them.
