# Design Thinking and Domain Modelling

This part of the course was inspired by [Chris Granger's post on the importance of modelling](http://www.chris-granger.com/2015/01/26/coding-is-not-the-new-literacy/) - the article is well worth a read.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67lim7f-SNw) takes you through applying design thinking to something we take for granted everyday - the London tube map.
