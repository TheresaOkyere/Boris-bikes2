# How to ask questions that people are likely to answer

### Assuming you're posting the question on-line and you want help / responses

- **Make it easy for them** to help you (obvious, but really try hard to do this)

#### Checklist

1. **Show the code**: Always link to the Github repo, unless you legally can't
2. **Show the output**: Your error messages, log, display, screenshots, etc.
3. **Revise your question**: Based on the feedback you get
4. **Tip your community member on the way out**: Do give positive feedback for useful solutions
5. **REMEMBER**: Always make your best effort to find an existing answer (and list those answers in your question)
