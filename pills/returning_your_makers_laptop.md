# Returning your Makers laptop at the end of the course

This is a kind reminder that the laptops have to be returned by the last Friday of the course.  Ideally before the demo presentations (graduation). Please keep the laptop that you need for the presentation and return the others before.

## Remember to

1. Clean the laptop using the wipes in the stationary cabinet. Try to imagine how you'd want it to look if you were starting in next week's cohort!
2. Reset your computer account password to something generic (e.g. Password1, DemoDay, etc.) and write it on a post-it, and stick it on the laptop.
3. Report any damages or hardware problems.
4. Return it to a member of the Ops team (Sarah, Jess, or Jodi) on the first floor before the presentations.

Thank you!
