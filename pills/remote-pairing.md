## Introduction

Remote pairing is a form of :pill: [pair programming](./pairing.md) used when you and your pair are in different locations. Remote work is common in the tech industry and there are many tools available to enable teams that are distributed across multiple locations to collaborate effectively.

## Pre-requisites

Before remote pairing learn about:
- :pill: [Working from home](./working-from-home.md)
- :pill: [GitHub collaboration](./github_collaboration.md)

## Collaboration tools

### Slack

Slack provides rich group chat that we'll use throughout the course.

Use **direct messages** to communicate with your remote pair.

We recommend installing Slack on your mobile phone as a backup, so that you can message your pair if you get disconnected.

### GitHub

We will use GitHub throughout the course to host and collaborate on projects.

Add your pairs as collaborators on all the GitHub repos you pair on. See :pill: [GitHub collaboration](./github_collaboration.md).

### Zoom

We recommend Zoom for video conferencing and remote pairing because it has a good reputation for meeting quality. Free accounts can have unlimited 1 to 1 meetings with no time limit.

**Features**
- video conferencing
- screen sharing
- give & request remote control
- whiteboard
- annotation tools (viewers can draw on shared screens and whiteboards)

**Install Zoom**
1. Download the Zoom client from https://zoom.us/download
1. Sign up for a free Zoom account

**Quickstart**
1. Create a new meeting
1. Click `Invite`, then `Copy URL`
1. Start a direct message with your pair in Slack
1. Share the URL with your pair

### Others

There are many other collaboration tools available. Any tool that enables you and your pair to edit in realtime is worth trying:

- [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/)
- [Miro](https://miro.com) (formerly Realtimeboard)
