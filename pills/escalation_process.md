# The Escalation Process

You're stuck on a problem.  Below is a list of possible ways to find a solution.  Work through them in order.

At Makers, you're learning to learn.  This is why the list below prioritises techniques that aid self-reliance and skill-building.  But, as a developer, it's expected that you ask for help when you need it.  So, the list also includes ways to get help from others, too.

## The Process

1. If you're stuck on a bug, follow the process in the [debugging](./debugging.md) :pill:.

2. Come up with a clear description of the problem you're having.  "It's broken" is not a problem description.  To help you produce a clear description:
  * Make a list of words that feel related to the problem.
  * Gather information from any errors you're getting.

3. *Pair Partner.* Bounce ideas off them, discuss, and [rubber-duck debug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). Imagine you are seeing the problem for the first time.

4. *Google.* Research the problem using the description you created in step 1.

5. *Diagram.* Draw boxes and arrows, or whatever you like.  Get ideas out of your head and onto paper.  This makes it be easier to manipulate, examine and generate ideas.

6. If it's a technical issue, use #slack-overflow! Search [old questions](https://github.com/makersacademy/slack-overflow/issues?q=) or [create a new one](https://github.com/makersacademy/slack-overflow/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=student-question.md&title=) to ask the community.

7. *Ask your cohort.* Remember everyone is on the same learning journey it's likely they are wrestling with similar issues. Send your question (or a link to your slack-overflow issue) to your cohort channel :)

8. *Ask a coach.* If all else fails, get some 1-1 help from a coach. This help may come in the form of more questions!

Coaches will be available in the **#coaches** slack channel during coaching hours (9:30am to 12:30pm) to support you. A coach will react to your message with a thumbs up emoji to say they are taking your question, and theyâ€™ll reach out directly on slack or zoom, depending on the nature of the question.
