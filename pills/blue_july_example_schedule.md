## Workshops

Practical workshops are interactive sessions where you practice a developer skill. For example: debugging, or domain modelling. They are guided by your coach, but you will spend most of your time doing, rather than listening.

Reflective workshops are similar, but you will focus more on building your skills of reflection to help you improve your learning, your process, and your code.

## Careers

* From week 6, there will be one careers session per week.
