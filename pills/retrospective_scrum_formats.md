Scrum
-----

Wikipedia defines [Scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) as "a flexible, holistic product development strategy where a development team works as a unit to reach a common goal" for software development, but the concept of a daily Scrum or "Standup" is used outside software development to coordinate many kinds of teams.  The key objective is to keep everyone in the loop with what each other is doing, by having a regular time at which every member of the team present and each can quickly report on what they've been doing, what they are stuck on, and their immediate plans.  

One simple '[daily scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Daily_scrum_meeting)' technique is to go round each person in the group and have each person answer the following three questions.

1. What did you do?
2. Anything blocking you?
3. What are your plans?

Ideally scrums will not last longer than 15 minutes.  Each person should spend no more than a minute or so on their questions.  Any longer discussions that break out should be moved to meetings at later dates.  

Retrospective
--------

Retrospectives also come from Agile methodology:

Retrospectives should be time boxed (30mins, 1, 2 or 3 hours) and used to look back at the changes that were made, how they worked out, new problems that arise; a general looking back at what worked and what didn't work.  Here are some alternate formats:

* StartStopContinue - everyone writes down things they think should be started, stopped and continued, and these are all written up in a shared space, for subsequent discussion
* LikeLoveLoathe - everyone writes down things they like, love and loathe, and these are all written up in a shared space, for subsequent discussion
* Fishbowl - only two people (sitting on special seats) can talk at one time - people queue up to take those seats

Planning
-------

Planning meetings should focus on making plans of action for the next short time period, e.g. 1 week
