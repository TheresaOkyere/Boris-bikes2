# User stories

**User stories** are a mechanism for capturing, defining and communicating the requirements of a system using a ubiquitous and plain English format.  The user in a particular user story is generally a stakeholder of the system and could be an end-user, an administrator, a technical-support superuser and so on.

As a way to start any good software project, user stories are created in collaboration with the customer or client and get us thinking about the high-level problem **from the user's perspective**.

User stories comprise three sections: *Stakeholder*, *Motivation* and *Task*, commonly in the following format:

```
As a <Stakeholder>,
So that <Motivation>,
I'd like <Task>.
```

You may find user stories written similarly to the above but with the three sections in a different order, or with different headings, but that's fine.

We identify user stories by discussing with a customer and listening to or prompting for user requirements.

Here's what a user story might look like if it were used to describe a user story (see footnote 1):
```
As a conscientious software developer
So that I can understand the needs of the user and communicate effectively with my client
I'd like a recognised technique for capturing and defining requirements in plain English
```

## Footnote
1. You might call this a meta user story (see footnote 2).
2. This is geek humour.
