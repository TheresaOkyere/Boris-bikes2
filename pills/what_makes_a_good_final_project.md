## What is a good idea for a final project?
There are many ways for a final project to stand out. Usually a great final project hits 1 or more of the following criteria:
    
- **The product solves a real problem**
    - What kind of person would use your application? Have you actually asked them? Why would they use your application? What value would they get out of it? Why would they not prefer other existing solutions? Keep asking questions like this!
    - Doesnâ€™t mean that any money has to be made off the back of it.
    - How will you communicate the usefulness of your final project?  

- **The product is technically interesting**
    - Solves a technically difficult problem.

    - Uses a language, framework, or technology not yet encountered on the course.
    - How will you communicate how your product is technically interesting?   

- **The product is made to a high standard**
    - The code is exemplar, it demonstrates sophisticated design principles, and the test coverage is pushing 100%.
    - How do you plan to communicate the quality of your project?   

- **The product offers a great user experience**
    - Fortunately, this communicates itself.

- **The story around the building of the project**
    - How will you communicate what you learned and how you evolved as a team?
