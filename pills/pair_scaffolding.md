Pair Scaffolding
================

:construction: UNDER CONSTRUCTION :construction:

Pair Scaffolding is the process of a third person working with two pairing programmers to help those programmers with their pairing style and their use of the [pairing protocols such as ping-pong, change-the-message, one-undermanship](pairing.md#detailed-pair-programming-methodologies) and so on.

It is different from simply helping programmers with a technical issue in that pair scaffolding focuses on trying to help improve the pairing technique of the pair programmers so that they can solve the technical challenges themselves.  This extends to advice on how to communicate, screen set up, seating, position of keyboards, frequency of driver/navigation rotation and other logistics not directly related to solving a particular technical challenge.

It also involves helping the pair have a constructive dialogue about the problem they are working on together.  The pair scaffolder should try to avoid answering technical questions directly and instead re-ask questions from one pair to the other pair partner, e.g.

```
Pair A: Why are we getting this error message?

Scaffolder: Good question, Pair B, why do you think we are getting this error message?

Pair B: I don't know I'm totally stuck

Scaffolder: Let's read the error message carefully and guess

Pair B: Well it says there's a cross browser security error, but I don't know what that is?

Scaffolder: Pair A, can you guess what the error means?

Pair A: I guess it's that we can't talk to the server?

Scaffolder: Pair B, what do you think of that idea?

Pair B: I suppose so ...

Scaffolder: And how might we find more information about what the error message means?

Pair B: we could google the error ... [Pair B starts to google]

Scaffolder: very good, but let's take the core part of the error; the part that doesn't mention any of our code fragments, enclose that in quotes ...
```

As you can see from the above example, the scaffolder can still provide some tips and tricks about how to make progress, but where possible, instead of just explaining things directly the scaffolder works on trying to improve the pairs' collaboration "process".

Here are some screen recordings of pair scaffolding sessions in action.  The ones in this playlist are slighlty artificial in that they are pairing sessions that brought together two programmers specifically for pairing, when perhaps ideally the pair scaffolding coach works with an existing pair who have already selected a task and have been working on it for some time.

Below we have some pair scaffolding in the wild with a coach and two programmers working on rails tutorials, and also another artificial pair scaffolding as part of a coach workshop on scaffolding.
