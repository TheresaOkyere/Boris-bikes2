# The JavaScript ecosystem

Congratulations on making it this far through the MA course. Now take a deep breath, because you're about to be thrown headfirst into the wild west, also known as the current JavaScript ecosystem.

## What's happening, JavaScript?

Start by reading [this article](http://manuel.bernhardt.io/2014/12/30/generation-javascript/) carefully. It pretty much summarizes most of what you need to know about the current state of JavaScript. At a more specific level, here is a brief rundown of some of the more important competing technologies at the moment, which you may or may not wish to explore more:

- Server side JS: [Node](https://nodejs.org/) vs [io.js](https://iojs.org/en/index.html)  
- Front end frameworks: [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) vs [Ember](http://emberjs.com) vs [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) vs [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) vs too many more to name  
- Angular itself: [Angular 1.x vs Angular 2](http://blog.zenika.com/index.php?post/2014/12/05/Why-Angular-has-to-break-everything-in-the-2.0)  
- Languages that compile to JavaScript: [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/), [Clojurescript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript), [Opal](http://opalrb.org/)... even [DogeScript](https://dogescript.com/)  
- Various compiled, JavaScript based supersets: [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), [AtScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AtScript), [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/)
- Build tools: [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) vs [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)  
- Utility libraries: [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) vs [Lo-Dash](https://lodash.com/) vs...  
- Loading JavaScript dependencies: [Browserify?](http://browserify.org/) [WebPack?](http://webpack.github.io/) [RequireJS?](http://requirejs.org/)
- [Functional or OO JavaScript?](http://thoughtsonscripts.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/javascript-functional-or-object.html)  
- JavaScript itself: [ES5 vs ES6](http://www.topicmatch.net/?p=28)  

Confused yet? You should be. But, don't worry too much.

## Why are you telling me all this?!

At the moment, everything in JavaScript is very new and moves very fast. As a web developer, you should at least have a passing interest in this - for now, JavaScript is the only language that can be run client-side in the browser out of the box. [Some people even think that JavaScript is the future](http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2014/07/14/what-is-the-most-valuable-programming-language-to-know-for-the-future-and-why/). Whether or not this is the case, there are plenty of jobs out there that require JavaScript skills. However, the main point is the tools and frameworks you learn now may be obsolete within a few months.  

## So, what should I learn?

You should learn how to write good, clean, test-driven code, leveraging the best tools for the job. In this case, the good news is that because JavaScript is the only thing that runs in the browser, the common theme linking all of these frameworks, languages and tools is... **JavaScript**. The exact configuration of libraries you will ultimately use depends on what your future employer's developers have decided on - if your basic JavaScript and development skills are good, picking up the specific details should be fairly easy.

## tl;dr

1. Write small, testable units of code  
2. TDD! TDD! TDD!  
3. Use build and automation tools where possible  
4. Use linters  
5. Pick a well respected style guide and stick to it  
6. Pick a framework or library that interests you but don't get too attached to it  
7. Explore, widely
