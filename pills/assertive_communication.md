# A Six Step Guide to Raising a Difficult Issue

### 1. State the behaviour that is troubling you.
#### e.g. "I find it upsetting when you talk over me during a pair session."
n.b. It's really important not preface this with a positive_statement + BUT, e.g. "You're normally a really thoughtful person, but I find it upsetting when you talk over me when we pair."

When we hear that kind of 'but', we know we're not going to like what comes next, and we instinctively resist whatever the person has to say. So it's better to just raise the issue straightforwardly—it may feel more uncomfortable to you, but it's worth it—the listener will be far more receptive as a result.

### 2. State specific instance(s) of the behaviour that is troubling you.
#### e.g. "I found it upsetting when we were troubleshooting issue x of problem y this morning, and again when we were refactoring our solution to problem z in the afternoon."
Concrete examples are always best, as people can't always remember what happened, especially if they're not aware they were upsetting you. Providing specific examples means they're much more likely to remember what you are talking about.

### 3. Explain why the behaviour made you feel as it did.
#### e.g. "I found it upsetting because it made me feel unvalued as a partner, and unable to contribute at your level. More simply, it also prevented me from programming, and so from improving, which is why I'm here."
If you don't explain your response, others may find it confusing, or maybe even think it's unwarranted. Explaining lets you show them otherwise, and, if necessary, gives them the chance to question whether your response was reasonable. Sometimes that's part of the process—communication is two-way!

### 4. Explain what you'd like to change.
#### e.g. "I'd appreciate it if you worked on checking yourself while I'm talking, and, as a rule, waited for a pause in my speech before voicing your own thoughts."
You've got to say want you want, or others just won't know.

### 5. Consequences.
#### e.g. "Otherwise this will continue to make me unhappy when we pair, and I think our working relationship will deteriorate. Besides, I don't think either of us will be getting the most out of the course if we're not truly collaborating."
This is _not_ a threat, it's just explaining what will happen if the behaviour continues. Again, it's important for people to understand why you think change would be good, and avoiding negative future consequences is always one of the reasons.

If you say you'll take action e.g. report them for something, make sure you're prepared to follow through. Because if the behaviour continues and you don't follow through, you won't be taken seriously next time you raise the issue.

### 6. Positives.
#### e.g. "And I am really grateful for what you bring to our pairing sessions. Aside from these situations, I learn a lot when I'm working with you, and I have a lot of fun too. I'd be sad to lose that, so I really hope we can work this out and build on all the good things that make pairing together valuable and enjoyable!
Compliments come at the end, not the start (see step 1 if you've forgotten why). Because when you've been critical of someone, it is helpful and kind to remind them of their value. Just make sure you do it all in the right order.

n.b. Being nice != dismissing everything you've just said. If you're feeling uncomfortable you may feel the urge to do this, but don't — it defeats the purpose of raising the issue in the first place. Stand by your words—they were reasonable and sincere.
