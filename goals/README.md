</dl>

This is what we mean by success at Makers. It runs through everything we do.

Your success here is determined by a precise but challenging question — are you achieving your goals? This requires you to not only understand your goals and work towards them, but also put time and effort into understanding your progress towards them.

Makers is designed to prepare you for success in the world, and the world works the same way. From the smallest garage start-up to the most successful multinational, from community enterprises to the world's most impactful charities — throughout history people have used goals to help them bring about the world they wanted to live in.

The goal-related skills you develop here will help you take control of your career and your life. The technical skills you learn will give you the most powerful tools that presently exist for achieving those goals.

We're excited to see what success means for you.

## What are your responsibilities?
Education at Makers Academy is designed to be empowering. Being a software engineer means looking at any problem you encounter and believing "With thoughtful effort, I can solve this."

We trust you with three responsibilities:

* Deciding what to aim for (your goals).
* Determining how to get there (your plan).
* Getting insight into your progress (self-assessment).

We believe that you are the best person to lead these things. This way, when someone asks you how it's going, you should know pretty accurately how you're doing as a software engineer, where you want to get to, and how you're going to get there.

You will know when to put in more effort, when to slow down, change focus, employ your strengths or strengthen your weaknesses. You will know when you are ready to apply for jobs. You're in the driving seat.

**This being said, there are a few rules that we ask you to follow while you are on the course, to create the best learning environment:**

* Attend Makers’ premises *full time*, unless agreed otherwise with a coach.

* Take part in the projects and assignments of the course, including team projects.

* Work towards the goals of the course as outlined by the coaching team. See the [course level goals here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/goals/course_goals.md).

* Frequently seek feedback on your work in order to achieve a professional standard.

_Please note that not respecting these may void your job offer guarantee. Read more: [Job offer guarantee: Terms & Conditions - Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/job-offer-guarantee-terms/)_


#### What should I do if something comes up and I an unable to come onsite for a day/half-day

* As soon as you know you won't be able to be in, send a message to a coach. ` Hi, I am unable to come in <today/tomorrow/date>, because of <X>.`

* On the day, send a message on your cohort channel, with a `@` mention to your pair for the day (if pairs have been released).

#### What should I do if something comes up and I an unable to come onsite for more than a day

* As soon as you know you won't be able to be in, send a message to a coach. We'll have a discussion about the best strategy for you to stay on track with your learning.

## What are coaches' responsibilities?
So what's our job?

* To support you with the above.
* To provide an environment with the tools and motivation necessary to achieve your goals.

Not everyone will come here knowing how to take control of their own journey — and that's fine. It's our job to give you the prompts and starting-points to train the habits of planning and self-assessment.

And then there's the matter of making the environment here as rich in opportunities to learn as possible. If you're not sure whether your code is readable or not, it should be easy to learn how to determine that, execute it, and then engage productively with the task of improving your code. Moreover, the atmosphere and people around you should inspire you to be better.

## What is your day like?
In weeks 1-5:

### Morning
* **09.30–12.30: Goal-directed project work.** You'll work independently on projects to achieve goals. You'll use [Diode](https://diode.makersacademy.com/) to self-assign projects and assess your progress. Coaches will be running workshops, mini projects, 1:1s, or generally available to chat to.
* **12.30–13.30: Lunch.** Go out in droves to one of Shoreditch's fine local eateries, or there's often a lunchtime talk from one of the many CTOs that our hiring team speak to!

### Afternoon
* **13.30–14.00: Meditation.** Programming is extremely challenging. Meditation helps keep a lid on things, keeps you grounded, and helps keep your brain sharp.
* **14.00–18.00: Challenges in pairs.** You'll work on a different set of challenges every week and with a different person every day. These form the main thread of the course and ensure everyone comes out with common important skills like debugging, pair programming, and web development.
* **17.00–18.00: Yoga.** Tuesdays and Thursdays.

The team projects follow the same pattern but instead with 
- **09.30-12.30: Group project work.**
- **14.00-18.00: Group project work.**

Most weekends you'll plan how to achieve your goals within the context of a  weekend challenge that we provide.
