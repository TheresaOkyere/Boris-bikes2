# Recipe: I help others become better (with code review)

We'll focus on helping others improve, as a key skill of a good developer in a team. The better everyone in your team is, the better work everyone can do, the better your codebase gets, the more value you deliver to customers.

## Getting started

You'll each be reviewing a colleague's code today. This morning the rule is: you can't touch your own code!

* **10:00: Code review introduction.** A brief introduction to reviewing code in a way that genuinely helps your colleagues improve.
* Follow this process
  * Read [this guide to code review](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/how-to/code-review.md)
  * Read the [Four rules of simple design](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html). This will help you understand high level code design principles.
  * Review your colleague's code without referring to the rubric. Stretch yourself to see how much feedback you can think of before you move on. Write it down, you'll share it later.
  * Use the code review rubric to generate some more feedback for your colleague (if available, it will be in the challenge repo under `docs/`).
  * Share your feedback with your colleague.
* **11.30: Reflective discussion.** A coach-facilitated discussion about feedback and code review.

## Challenging yourself

* Fork your colleague's repository and refactor their code to improve it. Use small commit messages where the commit messages explain what you've done and why.
