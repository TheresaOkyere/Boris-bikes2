# Project: Test drive a notes app

To achieve these goals:
  >"I can TDD anything"
  >"I can test-drive my code"
  >"I can build with objects"

## Action Plan
Test drive a notes app with the following interactions:
  - User can add a note with a title and a body
  - User can see a list of all note titles.
  - User can pick a note and see its title and body.

The user typing code in IRB as an interface is fine for this.

  - [The RSpec intro](http://rspec.info/)

## Evidence Plan
  - Did you manage to write all your tests before your code?
  - Did you achieve all your intended functionality?
