# Recipe: Writing Readable JavaScript


## Getting Started

Below are a handful of kata that you can use to practice test-driving development in JavaScript. Choose one of the kata to work on this morning, if you complete it then simply re-start the same kata from scratch.

Follow this guidance when completing the kata
- Test drive your code
- Focus on the readability of the code
- Follow the Red/Green/Refactor process - only refactor once you have a passing test
- Consider asking a peer to review your completed kata
- When you have completed the kata, submit it for a readability review [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc2hBDxS5BIB_skKn3fB0ER3chaotdktXlKjl1tqNkEy1ItWQ/viewform)

#### Leap Years

As a user, I want to know if a year is a leap year, So that I can plan for an extra day on February 29th during those years.

Acceptance Criteria:

- All years divisible by 400 ARE leap years (so, for example, 2000 was indeed a leap year),
- All years divisible by 100 but not by 400 are NOT leap years (so, for example, 1700, 1800, and 1900 were NOT leap years, NOR will 2100 be a leap year),
- All years divisible by 4 but not by 100 ARE leap years (e.g., 2008, 2012, 2016),
- All years not divisible by 4 are NOT leap years (e.g. 2017, 2018, 2019).

#### Diamond

Given a letter, print a diamond starting with ‘A’ with the supplied letter at the widest point.

For example: print-diamond ‘C’ prints

```
  A
 B B
C   C
 B B
  A
```

#### 99 Green Bottles

Print the lyrics of the 10 Green Bottles song, using numbers e.g. 

```
99 green bottles hanging on the wall,
99 green bottles hanging on the wall,
and if 1 green bottle should accidentally fall,
there'll be 98 green bottles hanging on the wall

through to....

1 green bottle hanging on the wall,
1 green bottle hanging on the wall,
and if 1 green bottle should accidentally fall,
there'll be no green bottles hanging on the wall
```

Extension: **ninety-nine** green bottles... through to **one** green bottle
