# Losing and Winning

[Back to the Challenge Map](README.md)

Our game can now attack a player and change turns. It shows us hit points, and we can damage player hit points. We can play with two players! Now we need to make sure players can win or lose, too.

Here is our User Story:

```

So I can Lose a game of Battle,
I want to see a 'Lose' message if I reach 0HP first
```

In this challenge, you will implement losing.
