# DevOps

## Learning objectives

By the end of this course, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to these questions:

* **Can you explain what DevOps is about and where it fits in the SDLC?**
* **Can you explain some advantages of applying DevOps practices?**
* **Can you explain what's the Cloud?**
* **Can you create a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions?**
* **Can you deploy a static site to an S3 bucket on AWS using the existing pipeline to automate the process?**

### What's DevOps?

Before we dive into trying to define DevOps, it's worth knowing some relevant history:

In 2007-2008, the devs and IT operators communities realised their teams basically did not work together and did not communicate efficiently either, which resulted in many unhappy customers.

DevOps then was born as an effort to close the gaps between the different teams.

As defined in Stack Overflow, DevOps acknowledges the interdependence of software development, quality assurance, and IT operations, and aims to help an organization rapidly produce software products and services and to improve operations performance.

DevOps is a philosophy, a culture that can be adopted in a team!


### Where DevOps fits in the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

Note that the SDLC can take from hours to months depending on specific context.

1. **Planning**: We gather the requirements from the client, and then a set of possible solutions is proposed
2. **Analysis**: This is where we deep dive into the requirements
3. **Design**: Solutions are designed and shown to the client
4. **Development**: This is the stage where the actual solution is programmed
5. **Testing**: QA engineers search for bugs and make sure all required features are included. It is common practice to have some sort of staging environment where the changes are deployed to before going to production.
6. **Deployment**: Once the team is confident the requirements and successfully included, the software then is released to production. Based on production feedback, the cycle starts again.

We can consider the SDLC as the **What**, whereas DevOps is one of the parts that defines the **How**
