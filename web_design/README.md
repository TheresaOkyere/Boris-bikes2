# Web design

## Learning objectives

* I can build a fully styled responsive web page
* I can pass design task tech tests

## Overview

This is a set of exercises (still in development), that creates a fully styled web page.

## Disclaimer

Each step includes a design to be coded. The designs won't give you all the information you need. Some information you want may be missing and other things might be ambiguous. To work through these issues you'll need to consider the intent of the designer. And you might judge the intent wrong, that's OK, that's part of the process.
