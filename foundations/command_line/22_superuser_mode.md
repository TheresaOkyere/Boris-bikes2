## Superuser mode
Some actions on the computer require administrative (or superuser) privileges. The name of the superuser is `root`. If you list the /etc directory where many of the system configuration files are stored, you'll see that all of them are owned by root.

```shell
; ls -l /etc/

A superuser has all rights and permissions to all programs. In other words, the superuser can do any action on the computer. Working as a root is dangerous since entering a wrong command or making a one-character typo can cause significant damage to the system. For example, there's a world of difference (or just one dot) between deleting all files in the current directory

`rm -rf ./*`

and deleting all files on your hard-drive, ignoring read-only flags and avoiding warnings

`rm -rf /*` **(Don't try this at home!)**

Therefore, it's considered bad practice to work as a root on a permanent basis. Instead, you use a normal account with limited privileges (e.g. you can't do `rm -rf /*` and other dangerous things) but switch into a superuser mode only as necessary.

You can execute a command as a superuser by prefixing it with `sudo`. For example, if you want to delete a file you haven't got permissions to delete and you know the superuser password, you can

`sudo rm inaccessibleFile`

It will ask you for the password and then the command will be executed with superuser privileges.
