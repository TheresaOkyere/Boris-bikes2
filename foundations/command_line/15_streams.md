## Streams
Every program on your computer has at least three 'standard streams' associated with it. Streams are how the program sends outputs and receives inputs.

* The keyboard is referred to as an input stream. By reading from the input stream your program can read what you have typed on the keyboard.
* The screen is referred to as an output stream. By sending data to the output stream, a program can print something on the screen.
* There is also an error stream that is usually sent to the display as well but is used only to print error messages.

The input stream is usually called `STDIN` and has number 0. The output stream is `STDOUT` (#1) and the error stream is called `STDERR` (#2).

Why do we need to know all of this? Because we can redirect the streams, connecting different streams from different programs. This will allow us to perform some sophisticated tasks.
