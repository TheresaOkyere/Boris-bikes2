# Spring Break Information for Developers on Immersive

Hello everyone! Makers is closed for a spring break for the week of Jun 21st. It has been a challenging time over the past year, and we would encourage you to use this time to refresh.

## Meeting up

If you'd like to meet up with your cohort in person we would definitely encourage it, while following the government guidelines, and will be providing a small budget of £20 pp to spend on entertainment or travel to facilitate this. [You can read about how to submit receipts here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ROS4bZfghlJp7gRtpADtWTd0kTwRh1jpePBLk0nSC5A/edit#)

## Programming

If you, like me, find programming not just a challenging profession but also an interesting intellectual pursuit, you might enjoy the following challenges.

### Exercism

[Exercism](https://exercism.io) is a good website for learning your second programming language or beyond. I'd suggest:

* Python
* Java
* Typescript
* Go
* Rust

#### Reasons to pick this

* You'd like to learn a new language.
* You'd like to expand the breadth of your programming knowledge

### Birthday App

> Your challenge is to build a web app that will ask the user for a name and birthday.

[Get started here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/intro_to_the_web/post_challenges/birthday_app.md)

#### Reasons to pick this

* You'd like to develop or refresh your understanding of simple web apps.
* It's your birthday this week.

### Cipher World Exercises

> Your mission is to build a program that can encrypt and decrypt files with a chosen cipher.
>
> Each part of this adventure has a set of Acceptance Criteria: these are mostly written as indicated method calls and their expected return values. Find part1, and start there. Grab the method calls and expectations, use a testing framework of your choice to speed your development, and start designing and test-driving.

[Get started here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/practicals/adventures/cipher-world)

#### Reasons to pick this

* You'd like the idea of encrypting secrets.
* You'd like to develop your programming skill with some carefully sequenced exercises from simpler to more challenging.

### Learning by Building RSpec Exercise

> We're going to build RSpec, step by step.
>
> In the process, we'll prove to ourselves that our tools aren't magic. They're made up of simple concepts that we can understand, with enough time and thoughtfulness.

[Get started here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/adventures/learning_by_building_rspec.md)

#### Reasons to pick this

* You're curious as to how RSpec looks so different.
* You'd like to demystify RSpec through a detailed engagement with how it works.

### Hello Cloud World Mini-Course

> This short course is meant to provide you with a lightweight introduction to DevOps. We will learn what DevOps is, where it fits in current workflows and also get hands-on and tackle our first Cloud project focusing on some DevOps practices using a designated Cloud provider.
>
> At the end of it, you will be equipped with enough context to keep moving forward in your DevOps journey! 🔮

[Get started here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/devops)

#### Reasons to pick this

* You're interested in DevOps, Cloud Engineering, or how software systems actually get deployed.

### Algorithmic Complexity Course

> This course focuses on an aspect of Computer Science that is relished by many developers, called algorithmic complexity.
>
> This is the part of computer science that deals with how efficient programmes are. We will also take a deeper look at how programmes interact with memory, and how to use that to make our own programmes faster.

[Get started here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/algorithmic_complexity)

#### Reasons to pick this

* If you are interested in computer science.
* If you feel worried about missing some computer science concepts in your education (though note that it is rarely a problem at early stages).
* If you are interested in analysis and optimisation problems.

### Introduction to COBOL Course

> In this module you will learn COBOL the language. You will do so by going through a series of exercises, building up to a larger project. That larger project is a greetings card generator. By the end, you should be able to read and write straightforward COBOL programs that read, manipulate, and write data.

[Get started here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/cobol-intro)

#### Reasons to pick this

* While COBOL is still used quite widely, you will very probably never use it in your job.
* So you should pick this only if you are interested in historical programming languages.
