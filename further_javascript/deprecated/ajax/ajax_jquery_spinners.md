Let's adjust the simple profile application to ensure that it gives a good user experience even under poor network connectivity, and let's the user know when searches for users have failed or the network connection has timed out.

Here's an example of a message indicating we can't find a particular user:

![user not found](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r4gamssxfj3hgog/Screenshot%202014-12-02%2008.39.45.png?dl=1)

And here's an example of an animated spinner that can be shown to indicate that the network connection is in progress:

![spinner](http://traindaze.com/assets/images/loader.gif)

So we might worry about the user experience when the network connection is slow.  On mac we have a handy tool to simulate that situation.  Open Xcode --> Open developer tools --> More developer tools; there is a package available from Apple called "Hardware IO Tools for Xcode".  We're interested in the network link conditioner.  Let's try the github profile app with a high latency network connection - the user is left hanging.

Let's give the user some indication that the app is still working.  First we'll need a spinner gif; can grab that off Google - then we'll want to drop that into our html like so:

```html
<div class='profile-container'>
  <img src='spinner.gif'>
</div>
```

Let's check that appears.  Now we want that to be hidden by default:

```html
<div class='profile-container'>
  <img src='spinner.gif' class='spinner'>
</div>
```

```css
.spinner {
  display: none;
}
```

Now in our javascript we'll adjust it to that when we start to fetch user information we'll show the spinner:

```javascript
  function addProfileFromUsername(username) {
    $('.spinner').show();
```

and whether or not our network connection has been successful we'll then hide that spinner in the always promise:

```javascript
  .always(function(){
    $('#username').val('');
    $('.spinner').hide();
  })
```

Note that jQuery has these show and hide functions that are directly manipulating the CSS.  We could alternatively use the longer winded:

```javascript
  function addProfileFromUsername(username) {
    $('.spinner').css({display: 'block'});
```

```javascript
  .always(function(){
    $('#username').val('');
    $('.spinner').css({display: 'none'};
  })
```

Can see that these are completely identical by playing with the document elements in the browser console.  Also note that in this case it doesn't matter if we put `$('.spinner').show();` before or after our ajax call because?  … it's an asynchronous call.  Although probably easier for readability to have it first.

A final issue with the basic github profiles is that the current user not found message is in a clunky alert box.  Let's improve on that with a modal error message.  Let's create a div to house that in:

```html
<div class='modal'>
  <h2>User not found!</h2>
  <p>Could not find that User :-(</p>
</div>
```

with some styling

```css
.modal {
  position: absolute;
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  border-radius: 20px;
  border: solid 1px #ccc;
  background: #fff;
}
```

Let's see how that looks …

could use some improvement:

```css
.modal {
  position: absolute;
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  border-radius: 20px;
  border: solid 1px #ccc;
  background: #fff;
  text-align: center;
  top: 40%;
  left: 40%;
}
```

That's a bit better.

However we should probably go dynamic for the width and height too so some more tweaking gives us:

```css
.modal {
  position: absolute;
  width: 40%;
  height: 40%;
  border-radius: 20px;
  border: solid 1px #ccc;
  background: #fff;
  text-align: center;
  top: 30%;
  left: 30%;
}
```

which is more responsive to the browser size, but maybe let's change the font too:


```css
.modal {
  position: absolute;
  width: 40%;
  height: 40%;
  height: 200px;
  border-radius: 20px;
  border: solid 1px #ccc;
  background: #eee;
  text-align: center;
  top: 30%;
  left: 30%;
  font-family: Helvetica Neue;
}
```

let's use some css transitions that will make any change that we make look nice and hide it away till we need it:

```css
.modal {
  position: absolute;
  width: 40%;
  height: 40%;
  height: 200px;
  border-radius: 20px;
  border: solid 1px #ccc;
  background: #eee;
  text-align: center;
  top: 30%;
  left: 30%;
  font-family: Helvetica Neue;

  transition: all 1s ease;
  opacity: 0;
  -webkit-transform: scale(0.75);

}
```

Note that the leading hyphen means that this -webkit-transform will only work with newer chrome and safari browsers.  Let's also have another class for the modal when it is displayed:

```css
.modal.shown {
  display: block;
  opacity: 1;
  -webkit-transform: scale(1);
}
```

We can use the inspector to ensure that the additional class has the effect that we hoped, and then we can use jQuery to display the modal when an error occurs:

```javascript
.error(function(){
  $('.modal').addClass('shown');
})
```

Can also then add a close button and some javascript to remove it:


```javascript
$('.modal .close').on('click',function(){
  $('.modal').removeClass('shown');
})
```

Note that the modal will appear over other profiles and we can adjust that using the `z-index` css property.


Exercises:
------

* Get your Github Profile app ready for poor network conditions
* Get a nice modal error message
* Change the profile to display information relevant to Makers such as commits on projects and challenges

Footnotes:
------

* Could be setting a default image in the method if we wanted
* Could turn off the autocomplete on the form we could just of that in html with `autocomplete='off'`.
