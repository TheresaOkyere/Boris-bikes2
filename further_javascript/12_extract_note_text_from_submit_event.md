[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_track.md)

In this challenge, you'll practice exploring the contents of a JavaScript object.  You'll use this skill to get the text that was submitted via the create note form.

### Learning objectives covered

- Extract data from an event.

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] You can spike this code.
- [ ] Fill out and submit the note create form.  Find where the note text you entered (e.g. `Favourite drink: seltzer`) is stored on the `submit` event that was triggered.  To do this, `console.log` the `submit` event and use your browser JavaScript console to explore it.  `console.log` the note text to prove to yourself that you've got it.
