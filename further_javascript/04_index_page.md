# Spike to create and serve an `index.html` page for your app

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_track.md)

In this challenge, you'll create a static HTML page and make it available for browsing on your computer.

### Learning objectives covered

- Create a minimal HTML page.
- Serve a static website.

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

(You can spike this code.)

- [ ] Create an `index.html` file containing the minimal HTML structure.
- [ ] Add a `div` that has an `id` attribute set to `app` and contains the text `hello`.
- [ ] Install :pill: [node](../pills/node.md).
- [ ] Install `http-server` from :pill: [npm](../pills/npm.md).
- [ ] Run `http-server` to serve your `index.html`.
- [ ] Go to `http://localhost:8080/` in a browser to view your `index.html` page.  It should say `hello`.

> Why are you using node and a "server"? Does this mean that your frontend-only app actually has a backend? Kind of.  But it's a backend with very limited logic.  Try diagramming the architecture of your app so far to understand this better.
