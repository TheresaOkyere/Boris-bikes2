# Use TDD to finish the implementation of a single note page

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_track.md)

In this challenge, you'll complete the code that lets the user view a single note on its own page.  You'll give note models unique ids.  You'll link each note in the main page to its single note page.  And you'll write code to display the content for a single note.

Don't worry if you need to jump around between the three parts of this challenge.  They all interlock.  For example, if you get stuck on section 2, see if you can make progress on section 3 and then come back to section 2.

### Learning objectives covered

- Support multiple content "pages" in a frontend, single page app.
- Use the `hashchange` event to load page content when the browser URL changes.

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

#### 1. Note model unique `id`

- [ ] TDD giving each note model object a unique `id`.  The first note created would have an `id` of `0`.  The second note created would have an `id` of `1`. etc.

#### 2. Link each note to a page that displays the full note

- [ ] Read :pill: [frontend, single page app](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/frontend_single_page_app.md).
- [ ] Use TDD to update the note list view so that each note is linked to an appropriate URL for displaying that individual note e.g. `http://localhost:8080#notes/1`.
- [ ] Go to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.  You should be able to click on a note and be redirected to the URL for that note.  There should be no page refresh.  The page content shouldn't change.  (And you won't see the note, yet.)

#### 3. Load the content for the single note page

- [ ] Using TDD, update your `note-controller.js` to load content for the single note page.  The note controller code should listen for `hashchange` events.  When one happens, if the new browser URL is for a single note page, it should change the content of the `app` element to be the HTML for that note.
- [ ] Go to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.  You should be able to click on a note and see the full text of that note.  There should be no page refresh.
