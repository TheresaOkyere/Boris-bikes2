# Project track

You'll work in unchanging **teams of about four** for the whole week.

You'll **implement user stories** for a note-taking app.  No challenges, no walkthroughs.

## Structure of the week

### Notes app

Take [user stories for a notes app](notes_app_user_stories.md).  Use them to build a frontend, single page web app.

You can't use existing web frameworks, libraries or even a test library (e.g. no Angular, React, Jasmine, jQuery etc.).

No challenges.  No walkthroughs.

#### Guidance

Make sure to look at this [guidance on building a frontend, single page app](frontend_single_page_app_guidance.md)! It'll help you point yourself in the right direction when you're figuring out how to implement some of the trickier things.

#### Test library

Extract your own test library from your app.  See here for more [guidance on testing without a testing library and extracting your testing code into its own library](../pills/writing_tests_without_a_testing_library.md).
