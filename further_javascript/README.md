# Writing a frontend, single page app using only pure JavaScript (further JS)

## Learning objectives

### Course Goals

Ask yourself the same two questions:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?

#### Week Goals

By the end of the week your goal is to be able to say:

1. I can build a frontend single-page app using only pure Javascript.
2. I can request and use data from an external API.

That second goal may come later in the week or weekend.

### Concepts

* Frontend, [single page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA) web apps.
* Events and event handlers.
* Manipulating the [Document Object Model (DOM)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction).
* Asynchronous requests.
* Frontend templating.
* Frontend routing.

## Working Arrangement

This is a project week. You'll work in small teams for the whole week, using user stories to guide you (no challenges, no walkthroughs). Then you'll extract your own testing framework.

## Get started

Once you get your group assignment, you can get started.

It's going to be exciting!
