# Writing a frontend, single page app using only pure JavaScript (further JS)

## Learning objectives

### Course Goals

Ask yourself the same two questions:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?

#### Week Goals

By the end of the week your goal is to be able to say:

1. I can build a frontend single-page app using only pure Javascript.
1. I can request and use data from an external API.
1. I can explain that libraries are made of ordinary code that I could write myself if I needed to.

## Structure of the week

You'll work in unchanging **teams of about four** for the whole week.

You'll **implement user stories** for a note-taking app.  No challenges, no walkthroughs.

Then, you'll **extract your own testing framework**.

### Notes app

Take [user stories for a notes app](notes_app_user_stories.md).  Use them to build a frontend, single page web app.

You can't use existing web frameworks, libraries or even a test library (e.g. no Angular, React, Jasmine, jQuery etc.).

No challenges.  No walkthroughs.

#### Guidance

Make sure to look at this [guidance on building a frontend, single page app](frontend_single_page_app_guidance.md)! It'll help you point yourself in the right direction when you're figuring out how to implement some of the trickier things.

#### Test library

Extract your own test library from your app.  See here for more [guidance on testing without a testing library and extracting your testing code into its own library](../pills/writing_tests_without_a_testing_library.md).

#### Concepts

* Frontend, [single page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA) web apps.
* Events and event handlers.
* Manipulating the [Document Object Model (DOM)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction).
* Asynchronous requests.
* Frontend templating.
* Frontend routing.

## Get started

Once you get your group assignment, you can get started.

It's going to be exciting!
