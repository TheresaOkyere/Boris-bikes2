# Writing a frontend, single page app using only pure JavaScript (further JS)

## Learning objectives

### Goals for the week

Ask yourself the same two questions:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?

#### Primary goal

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

* **Can you write a frontend, single page app using only pure JavaScript?**

* As part of this primary goal, a sub-goal should be that you are able to explain and give an example of asynchronous behaviour in Javascript

#### Secondary goal

To help you towards your primary goal, your secondary goal will be to produce a diagram of how all the parts of your notes app interact.

* Draw the diagram on Tuesday.
* Each morning, update the diagram with your latest understanding.

Your diagram might include: model, view, controller, external API, browser page, unit tests, feature tests, static server, node, XMLHttpRequest, the DOM.

### Concepts

* Frontend, [single page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/dn463786.aspx) web apps.
* Events and event handlers.
* Manipulating the [Document Object Model (DOM)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction).
* Ajax.
* Frontend templating.
* Frontend routing.

## Working Arrangement

This is a project week. You'll work in small teams for the whole week, using user stories to guide you (no challenges, no walkthroughs). Then you'll extract your own testing framework.

## Get started

Once you get your group assignment, you can get started.

It's going to be exciting!
