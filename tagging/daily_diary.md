# Project: Daily Diary Application

To achieve these goals:
  > "I can learn anything by myself"
  > "I have a methodical approach to solving problems"
  > "I can model anything"
  > "I can program fluently"
  > "I can TDD anything"

## Action Plan
Build an application to store daily diary entries, using Sinatra and PostgreSQL.

For more information and user stories, refer to [this repository on GitHub](https://github.com/makersacademy/daily-diary-project)

## Evidence Plan
- I'll create a working implementation of the system described above (empirical)
- I'll be able to diagram the flow of information through my application, from user interactions through to the database (empirical)
- I'll share my diagram with a coach in order to receive feedback (credible)
