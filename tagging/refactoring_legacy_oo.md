# Project: Refactoring some legacy code using OO

To achieve these goals:
  > "I use my own initiative"
  > "I use a methodical approach to solving problems"
  > "I test-drive my code"
  > "I can design a system"
  > "I can write standards-compliant, clean object-oriented code"

## Action Plan
### Learn to
  - Identify poor quality code
  - Consider possible refactors using OO relationships
  - Implement refactors using OO relationships

## Useful resources
https://refactoring.guru/

### Exercise 1

Take a look at example_1 in this repository:

https://github.com/neoeno/student_directory_refactoring_exercise

Analyse the codebase for quality, identify some possible refactors, and then perform one.

Seek feedback from a peer with regards to whether or not you have improved the codebase.

After this, continue to refactor the example_1 codebase.

Get more feedback when you think you're done.

### Exercise 2
Analyse and refactor example_2 in the repository above.

## Evidence Plan
- Get regular feedback from your peers.
- Ask a coach for feedback when you're done with exercise 2.
