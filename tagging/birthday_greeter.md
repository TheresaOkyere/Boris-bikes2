# Project: Birthday greeter web app

To help you achieve these goals:
* I use a methodical approach to solving problems
* I test-drive my code
* I create effective documentation
* I can design and build user interfaces
* I can deploy web applications
* I can design a system
* I have a methodical approach to solving problems
* I can debug anything
* I can TDD anything
* I know how the web works
* I can build web apps
* I can build with objects
* I can test-drive my code

## Action Plan
In order to test my understanding of web apps and verify that I can build a simple web app with a form using an MVC framework, I will build a birthday greeter app.

[Instructions and mockups here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/intro_to_the_web/post_challenges/birthday_app.md)

## Evidence Plan
- Can you explain how the information flows between the browser and your website?
  - Which HTTP requests are sent by the browser?
  - What are the HTTP responses from the server?
  - Did you test drive the whole thing?
  - Do you have feature tests?
- Ask these questions of your code — the answers should all be yes:
  - Do the tests pass?
  - If you break the code, do the tests fail?
  - Is the code straightforward and easy to read? Does someone who isn't me think so?
  - Is the code well designed? (e.g. broken into multiple files, each with a single responsibility)
- What does a coach think of it?
