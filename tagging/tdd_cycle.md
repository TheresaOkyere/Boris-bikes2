# Project: TDD Cycle Decision Tree

To achieve these goals:

> "I test-drive my code"  
> "I can model anything"  
> "I can TDD anything"  
> "I can test-drive my code"

## Action Plan

Build a decision tree (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) for the TDD Cycle.

It should accept a User Story as an input. It should output a Feature.

It should include the following levels:

- Feature Test
- Unit Test
- Implementation

It should include Refactoring.

## Evidence Plan
- Try the decision tree out live. Does it work? Do you end up systematically following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle?
- Give it to someone else. When they follow it without interpreting it too much, do they end up doing the TDD Cycle?
- Show and explain your decision tree to a coach. Do they agree it's accurate?
