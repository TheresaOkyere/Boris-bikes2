# Project: Simple Checkout

To achieve these goals:
> "I know how my language works"  
> "I can build with objects"  
> "I can test-drive my code"

## Action Plan
Write the code for a supermarket checkout that can calculate the price of a number of items. Each item should be priced individually, and the checkout should be able to scan them in any order.

The requirements for the system are as follows:

> As a shopper  
> So I know how much an item costs  
> I would like to be able to see its price

> As a shopper  
> So that I can buy an item  
> I would like to be able to scan items at the checkout

> As a shopper  
> So that I know how much to pay  
> I would like to be able to see a total for all scanned items

> As a shopper  
> So that I know how much to pay  
> I would like to see all prices correctly formatted (£xx.xx)

You main focus here should be to follow a rigorous TDD process: RED, GREEN, REFACTOR!

## Evidence Plan
- You'll be able to explain the approach you took to writing your code and justify some of the decisions you made (emotional)
- You will have a well tested, working implementation of the system described above (empirical)
- You will discuss your approach with a coach, describing your TDD process, and will receive feedback (credible)
