# Project: The Airport Challenge
To achieve these goals:
  > "I write code others can easily understand"
  > "I know how my language works"
  > "I can test-drive my code"
  > "I can build with objects"

## Action Plan

Full instructions [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/airport_challenge)

Feel free to amend this plan, evidence, goals etc as much as you like to cater to your own journey.

## Evidence Plan
- Go through the review rubric in docs/
- Ask these questions of your code — the answers should all be yes:
    - Do the tests pass?
    - Does Rubocop pass?
    - If you break the code, do the tests fail?
    - Is the code straightforward and easy to read? Does someone who isn't me think so?
    - Is the code well designed? (e.g. broken into multiple objects, each with a single responsibility)
- Did you test drive the whole thing?
- What does a coach think of it?
