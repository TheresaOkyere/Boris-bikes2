# Project: Encapsulation & Cohesion Practical

To achieve these goals:
  > "I can build with objects"
  > "I can test-drive my code"

## Action Plan
Exercises and supporting material [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/object_oriented_design/encapsulation.md)

## Evidence Plan
- How comfortable do you feel assessing how cohesive a class is?
- Did you successfully break the SecretDiary class up into multiple cohesive classes?
