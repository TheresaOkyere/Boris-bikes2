# Project: JS Events practical

To achieve these goals:
  > "I know how my language works"

## Action Plan
https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/js-events/README.md

Clone the above repo and follow the instructions included in the readme. Focus in particular on trying to understand the flow of information through the application when an event is triggered.

Build up a step by step mental model of what happens and document it.

## Evidence Plan
- You will develop a clearer mental model of how information flows through a single page web app when an event is triggered (emotional)
- You will document your understanding in a way which helps you explain it to someone else (empirical)
