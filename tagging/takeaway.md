# Project: Takeaway Challenge
To achieve these goals:
  > "I have a methodical approach to solving problems"
  > "I can TDD anything"

## Action Plan
If you haven't watched the [Airport Challenge exemplar video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg0cFVLH_EM) yet, it's well worth it.

Full instructions [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/takeaway-challenge)

Feel free to amend this plan, evidence, goals etc as much as you like to cater to your own journey.

## Evidence Plan
- Go through the review rubric in docs
- Ask these questions of your code â€” the answers should all be yes:
- Do the tests pass?
- Does rubocop pass?
- If you break the code, do the tests fail?
- Is the code straightforward and easy to read? Does someone who isn't me think so?
- Is the code well designed? (e.g. broken into multiple objects, each with a single responsibility)
- Did you test drive the whole thing?
- What does a coach think of it?
