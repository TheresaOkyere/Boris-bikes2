# Project: FizzBuzz in a new language

To achieve these goals:
  > "I set my own direction"
  > "I know how my language works"

## Action Plan
Complete the FizzBuzz kata in a new and unfamiliar language!

The kata is available in a range of languages on CodeWars here : https://www.codewars.com/kata/fizz-buzz

The Primary goal of this exercise is to help develop a process which you can apply any time you want to pick up a new technology.

Think about the process you use to translate the requirements of this familiar problem and document it. This document should be something that you can refer back to next time you want to get started with a new language or framework.

## Evidence Plan
- You will feel more confident that you have a rigorous process for tackling problems in an unfamiliar language (emotional evidence)
- You will have a clearly documented process for tackling problems in an unfamiliar language (empirical evidence)
- You will discuss and receive feedback on this process with a coach (credible evidence)
