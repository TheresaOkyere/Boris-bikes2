## What is your day like?

### Modules 1–2

During these two modules we'll focus on the basic skills required of a software
developer. Your coach will schedule workshops and exercises to introduce you to
the tools and practices of self-directed learning.

### Modules 3–7

During these five modules, you'll have more time and flexibility to set your own
goals.

**Mornings**

* **Self-directed learning:** You'll work independently on projects to achieve
goals. You'll use self-assigned exercises and track your own progress. Coaches
will be running workshops, mini-projects, 1:1s and will be available to chat to.

**Afternoons**

* **Meditation:** Programming is extremely challenging. Meditation helps keep a
lid on things, keeps you grounded, and helps keep your brain sharp.

* **Pairing challenge:** You'll work on a different set of challenges every week
and with a different pair partner every afternoon. These form the main thread of
the course and ensure everyone comes out with common important skills like
debugging, working with different personalities, pair programming and
test-driven development.

**Individual challenge**

Each module will conclude with an individual programming challenge to cement the
skills you learnt during that module. As with all the programming tasks you'll
undertake here, the goal is to learn, rather than complete.

### Modules 8+ (in teams)

During these weeks you'll work in teams and organise yourselves into pairs and
schedule team meetings. You should also discuss your individual goals as a
team and find a path that allows you all to succeed.
