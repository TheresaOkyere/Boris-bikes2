# Advice from your peers: How to Succeed on the Course

 Here is some anonymised [raw feedback data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iab67so3To5neYnwY6IcF7VX3oLt9WvR2xun4eTxsxo/edit#gid=0) for the devs in cohorts since September 2018, added from the bottom - so scroll down for the most recent data.

They, as you will be, were asked a set of questions to reflect on in the 12th week of the course.

### Inquiry Project
- Find a common theme in the feedback for each of the three questions presented and share your learnings with your peer group.
- Consider adding a learning objective to a goal in your portfolio.
