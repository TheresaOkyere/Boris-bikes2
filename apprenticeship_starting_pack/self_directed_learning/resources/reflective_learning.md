# Reflective Learning

As a learner at Makers, we trust you with three responsibilities:

* Deciding what to aim for (your goals).
* Determining how to get there (your plan).
* Getting insight into your progress (self-assessment).

Reflective learning is a skill to practice and improve - the quicker it's improved, the quicker you'll succeed at learning what you aim for. To support your learning **check-in with a coach** during coaching hours **as often as you need** to feel like you're managing these responsibilities.

## Reflective Questions
Here are some questions to ask yourself - a coach will pose them to a learner - so **read and reflect** on your answers to them, or **discuss them with a coach**.

### Goals
- What are you learning at the moment and why is it important?
- Is your goal clearly defined and reasonable in scope?
- Are there any other goals to usefully consider?

### Plan
- What's your plan to get to your goal and is it reasonably achievable?
- What learning strategies and resources are you considering using?
- Is the evidence you plan to collect relevant and would it be convincing?
- Is there any other evidence to usefully consider?

### Self-Assessment
- How did your plan go?
- How are you measuring your learning progress at the moment?
- How do you know how good you are at the skill you're trying to learn?

### Feedback
- What kind of specific feedback will help you learn - and why?
- How can you improve at the skill you're currently learning?
- What's difficult or slow about the way you're applying the skill currently?

### Portfolio
- Do you know what a compelling portfolio looks like?
- Do you know what the course goal `xyz` means?
- Do you know the difference between credible, empirical, and personal evidence?
