# Tracking your learning

In self-directed learning, one of the important aspects is to keep track of your learning. By reflecting on what you have learnt and setting yourself goals on what to do next, you'll cement your understanding and focus your efforts.

* The [Portfolio Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o8uTAyPSSyD8eMAUOdMsAK9pDgBA2jVXc5-p3PS29lQ/edit#heading=h.bwbqjdsvw2lz) is one tool you can use to set goals for yourself and keep track of the evidences of having achieved said goals.


## Other examples from Makers devs
Here are other tools Makers Academy developers have used to track their learnings and reflections along the way. _N.B. These devs were studying at Makers Academy (not Makers Apprenticeships) so some of the terminology will be different._

* Masha (March 2019) has been using [Bear](https://bear.app/):
> For tracking my learning I’ve been using Bear notes extensively, marking every language (ruby, shell, JavaScript etc) and or topics (debugging, Tdd, modelling etc) with hashtags (extremely helpful feature of the app). I also created hashtags for each week and was putting corresponding stuff there. I’ve copied course outline file there as bear works perfectly with markdown
> Somewhere in the middle of the course I’ve upgraded to the pro version (less than 2 pounds I think a month) to sync it between all the devices plus there are other nice add-ons.

* Matt (March 2019) records all his notes/learning/feedback in a [Github repo](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio)
> It includes the goals, but also has all my projects, process, weekly goals (and in there my raw weekly notes), etc

* Guilherme has started writing a [blog](https://medium.com/@guilhermexunu) (April 2019)

* Kiah (April 2019) is using both a [blog](http://www.coderkiah.com) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/coderkiah/)

* Paul (March 2019) keeps all his notes, including reflections and feedback on [Github](https://github.com/Hives/makers-notes)

* Kim (March 2019) uses a custom tool:
> Here is a [coding tracker template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mm8v544mnflkrIPhc6b_-tEGTLq9BC22liuTOZ9th9g/edit?usp=sharing) I've been using to log my long-term goals, weekly goals and daily goals. It was inspired by one of my friends, Linh from Codebar. She did a talk ages ago on how she tracked her competencies in her first dev job :slightly_smiling_face:

* Steven (April 2019) writes notes in markdown (here is [one example](https://hackmd.io/s/S1otqj56V)). He also [records his screen regularly](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtXZ2rupF8wGyD5dFH3L0cQ/videos?view=0&sort=da&flow=grid) to be able to look back at his process.

## Inquiry Project

* Looking at examples on this page, try to describe why people have tracked their learnings. What value does it bring?
* Which methods are you most likely to use? Why?
