# How to gain insight into your progress
These are some prompts to help you find a place to start with self-assessment. Use these, but don't be limited by them — success will require going beyond these, to genuinely engage with what it means to be a great software engineer.

In general you should start with weak evidence and move to strong evidence. Each one will have a higher bar — the highest one is 'will someone hire me to do this?', but starting smaller will help guide you.

## I write good code

### Weak evidence (start here)
* Watch a video about code quality.  Can you summarise it at the end?
* Explain, to a more experienced developer, what makes good code.  Do they agree with you?

### Moderate Evidence
* Compare your code to someone else's.
* Ask a peer to give you feedback on some code you wrote.

### Strong Evidence
* Send a codebase you've written to a coach and ask them "If I submitted this as a tech test, do you think I'd get through to the next stage?"

## I can build web applications

### Weak evidence (start here)
* Reflect on your input during pairing sessions (in week 5 onwards).
* Plan how you would go about building a simpleweb application from scratch.
* Explain your plan to someone else and get feedback.

### Moderate Evidence
* Find commits that you have made on web application projects.
* Set up a database
* Read from and write to the database
* Build a simple web application (like the Rock, Paper, Scissors challenge)

### Strong Evidence
* Build a database backed web application (like the Chitter challenge)
* Deploy your database backed web application

## I make good products

### Weak evidence (start here)
* Describe what makes a good product
* Create some documentation for one of your projects
* Describe the software development lifecycle


### Moderate Evidence
* Ask someone to use your documentation to set up one of your projects.  Is the documentation sufficient?
* Build something to specification (an end of module challenge, perhaps)

### Strong Evidence
* Get user feedback on something you or your team has built

## I have good processes 

### Weak evidence (start here)
* Do you feel like you know where you need to get to by the end of the course, and how you're going to get there?
* Can you draw a diagram of how an application works?
* Can you explain what good developer process looks like?
* Watch a video of someone applying good processes.  Do you understand what they are doing?
* Is your team happy?  Ask them!

### Moderate Evidence
* Can you demonstrate your progress towards a goal?
* Is your team improving with every sprint?
* Create a screen recording of yourself doing some programming and watch it back.  Do you apply good process?

### Strong Evidence
* Are you achieving your goals?
* Share your screen recording with someone else and ask them for feedback.  Do they think you apply good process?
* Is your team achieving their goals?
