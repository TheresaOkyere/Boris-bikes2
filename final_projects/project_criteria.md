## Final Project Goals

It's time to get started on your final projects! Over the course of your time at Makers you've learned a bunch of of useful skills and it's really important that you keep working on them for the next two weeks.  

Even if your final project looks awesome, if your team's process was poor then it's not going to have been a great outcome for you, and your time spent working on it is likely to be far less enjoyable.

With this in mind, coaches will be looking for a few things from you as a measure of how well your team is working.

### Testing
- [ ] 90% or greater test coverage.
- [ ] Unit tests:
  - [ ] test one piece of your own logic.
  - [ ] fail if that logic breaks.
  - [ ] pass if it that logic produces the expected result.
- [ ] You can articulate why any test exists (or does not exist).
- [ ] Every feature is tested from the user's perspective.

### Good distribution of work
- [ ] Your team co-owns the code. Every member of the team can:
  - [ ] explain _why_ any part of the application exists (what user need it solves).
  - [ ] explain _how_ any aspect of the application works.
- [ ] Every member of the team has made commits.
- [ ] Every completed ticket has a closed (or merged) Pull Request.

### Quality of work
- [ ] Commit messages are clear and composed of:
  - [ ] a single line describing the changes made.
  - [ ] a description of the problem it solves, with reference to the user.
- [ ] The Linter passes on all commits.
- [ ] All commits have a low complexity score.
- [ ] All pull requests are peer reviewed. 

### Documentation
- [ ] There is up-to-date documentation: 
  - [ ] a project description.
  - [ ] how to install and run it.
  - [ ] how to run tests.
  
It's also a great idea for your team to keep some sort of record of your learning process.  This could take the form of a blog, a wiki or any other format you like.

## Additional Criteria – Weeks 8 and 9 (Engineering Projects)

- Merging any branch into `master` automatically deploys after passing automated tests.
- All code on `master` is containerized.
- `master` is deployed into production.
