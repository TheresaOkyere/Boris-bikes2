### Completion time - 1 week

This week's project is a clone of [Instagram](http://instagram.com). The goal is to continue to enhance our knowledge of Rails, introduce some more advanced concepts:

* Uploading and processing images using Paperclip, hosting via Amazon S3
* Managing secret information (e.g. private keys)
* Many-to-many relationships in Rails (with tagging)
* Geocoding with Google Maps
* Twitter Bootstrap
* Creating APIs using Rails + [jBuilder](https://github.com/rails/jbuilder)

We deployed to Heroku at the end of last week. For this project we should be deploying much more regularly - ideally a few times every day. This allows us to catch any deployment issues early.

## Version 1 - Image uploading

The fundamental feature of Instagram is that users can upload their photos to the service to share online - this is what we'll focus on first. For performance reasons, and because Heroku offers us very limited disk space, we'll use [Amazon's Secure Storage Service](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (S3) to persist our uploaded images.

It's very important to keep your S3 secret key - the key allows anyone use cloud computing resources at your expense! Use Rails's `secrets.yml`, and be sure it's in your `.gitignore`. If you accidentally push your secrets, immediately [revoke your secret key and generate a new one](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/wah-linux/getting-started-cleanup-key-pair.html).

### Specification

* Users can register/sign up (implemented with Devise)
* Users must be signed in to create a new posts
* Posts can be created by providing a title and attaching an image
* The image should be processed using Paperclip, to generate thumbnail-sized images
* The homepage should list all the uploaded thumbnails - users can click through to see full-sized images
* Images are hosted on S3. Stub calls to S3 for your test environment
* Ensure your S3 secret key *is not stored on Github*

### Version 1.5 - Integrate Bootstrap

![Twitter Bootstrap](http://www.revillweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/twitter-bootstrap.jpg)

To quickly improve the look of our site, we'll use a popular CSS framework - [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). Integrate Bootstrap using the [official SASS port](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass), and use it to add:

* A responsive grid of images on the front page
* A fixed navigation bar, with links to Login etc.
* Improved forms
* *Optional* - Full-sized images appear in modals

## Version 2 - Tagging

Next we'll add the ability for photos to be tagged, as in the original Instagram. This will introduce our first [many-to-many relationship](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#the-has-and-belongs-to-many-association) in Rails. Given the relative complexity of our tags implementation, we'll want to make use of unit tests to ensure we've covered all the various edge cases.

### Specification

* Users can specify a list of space-separated (or comma separated tags) - e.g. "#yolo, #swag"
* Tags should be created in the DB if they're novel (have never been used before), otherwise existing tags should be associated with the new post
* Duplicate tags (e.g. "#yolo, #yolo") should be stripped out
* Tags without a hash (#) at the beginning should be considered invalid
* Tags should be displayed underneath each post
* Users can click on tags to display *only* posts tagged with that tag
* *Optional* - Use a jQuery plugin like [Inputosaurus](http://sproutsocial.github.io/inputosaurus-text/) or [bootstrap-tags](http://timschlechter.github.io/bootstrap-tagsinput/examples/) to give a more pleasant UX for entering tags

## Version 3 - Geocoding and Maps

Finally we'll make our service location-aware. Users can (optionally) enter the address at which a photo was taken. Photos with locations display the option to show a map, with the location of the photo marked.

We have various options for geocoding (turning an address into latitude/longitude). It's more efficient to do it on the server-side, using a gem like [geocoder](https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder). However, for simplicity's sake, we'll use a pure JS solution, using the [Google Maps API v3](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/), and [gmaps.js](http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/).

### Specification

* Users can enter an address when creating a post
* Posts with addresses display a link to "View Map"
* When a visitor views the map a call is made to Google server's to geocode the address, then a map is rendered, centred on the resulting location
* *Optional* - A clickable marker should be pinned at the location of the photo. Clicking it displays the photo's title and `created_at` date.
* *Optional* - Use the Geolocation API to prefill the address field with the user's current address.
