# Checkpoint: HTTP

[Back to the Challenge Map](README.md)

Time to pause and reflect on what you've learned so far, so that you can track your progress towards the goals of this week.

The first four steps in this challenge focused on one of the weekly goals:

* Explain and diagram the HTTP request/response cycle

#### Each step has taken you a little bit closer to achieving that goal

* In step 1, you learned about how the web is made up of clients, such as your browser, and servers, like the machines that run Google search.

* In step 2, you were introduced to Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which is a set of rules (a protocol) that describes how clients and servers should communicate.

* In step 3, you learned that HTTP requests can contain parameters, embedded into the URL as a _query string_.

* In step 4, you learned about the different use cases for GET and POST requests.

#### Now test yourselves

A great way to test your understanding of this material is to diagram the process of a client sending a server a request. Spend 10 minutes doing that now, in as much detail as possible, and then compare your diagram to that of your pair. Are there any gaps or places where you were unable to go into as much detail? Make a note them – some will be filled in by the rest of this exercise.
