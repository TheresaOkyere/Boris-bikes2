# Engineering Project

## Pathways

- [Rails](./rails)
- [Java](./java)
- [Node](./node)
- [Python](./python)
- [C#](./csharp)

## Learning objectives

### Goals for the project

Ask yourself the same two questions:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?

#### Primary goals

By the end of the engineering project, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the primary question:

* **Can you use high-quality processes to build a project in a team?**


## What is a successful project?

This is not a test, nor a challenge to see how many features you can cram into the application.

**It is more important to pay attention to your learning objectives and the [Makers Engineering Project criteria](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/final_projects/project_criteria.md)**. The points listed in the criteria are general expectations of a good project.

## Schedule

- [Project Schedule](./week_schedule.md) for the two weeks

## Toolbox

Here are some [strategies](./toolbox.md) to use when facing some common problems. Feel free to submit new issues or PRs with more questions, or different solutions!

## Feedback

Whenever you want please share feedback! Here are some options for you
 - find a coach via slack or in person
 - open a Github issue or pull request with your thoughts and send it to a coach

## End of unit challenge

At the end of the 1st week of the project there's a challenge for each pathway. Use it as always: a tool to help you self-assess your understanding. There won't be a cohort review on the following Monday.

## Presentations

At the end of the project, each team will present the great work done!  They will talk through a very simple slide deck and do a quick demo of their project.  There's no need to spend ages planning or practising the presentation.  It's mainly to communicate about your learning, technical achievements, and show off your cool project to the rest of your cohort.

- [guidelines](./presentation_guidelines.md) to follow when planning your presentation.
