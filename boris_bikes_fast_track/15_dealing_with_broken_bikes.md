# Dealing with broken bikes

[Back to the Challenge Map](0_challenge_map.md)

Our system is looking good. We can vary the capacity of docking stations, but only at the point of creation. `DockingStation` instances will default to a capacity of 20 if none is provided. We're all tested, and our code is readable. Let's get harder!

We're now given three User Stories to implement:

```
As a member of the public,
So that I reduce the chance of getting a broken bike in future,
I'd like to report a bike as broken when I return it.

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can manage broken bikes and not disappoint users,
I'd like docking stations not to release broken bikes.

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can manage broken bikes and not disappoint users,
I'd like docking stations to accept returning bikes (broken or not).

```

In this challenge, you will implement the above features using the skills you have gained so far.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Implement a feature from scratch

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Complete the Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycle for each of the features above.

### Hints

<details><summary>CLICK ME</summary>
  <li>By now you should be getting to grips with the TDD cycle.  Tackle of the above user stories one at a time, going through the full process of unit testing, implementing the feature and and using IRB to confirm everything works.  Everything you need for this challenge has been covered in earlier steps - good luck!</li>
