# Boris Bikes Fast Track Challenges

London's [Boris Bikes](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/santander-cycles) (well, 'Santander Cycles') are awesome. Anyone can hire out a bike and ride it around London.

### Welcome to being a developer

Let's go back several years, to the days when there were no Boris Bikes. Imagine that you're a junior developer (that was easy). Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

To help structure your work, here are 20 challenges. They all build on one another. They require you to research things, to get stuck, and to find your own solutions. This is on purpose. A developer is a 'knowledge worker' - someone who will spend the majority of their time researching and learning how to solve problems. It'll suck for a bit, but with practice, you will get faster: and there's no better feeling than finding the answer to a problem that's been standing in your way for hours.

### Challenges

In the original version of Boris Bikes, each challenge step is accompanied by a walkthrough, which provides precise instructions for when people get blocked. You've elected to do the fast track version, which does not come with those walkthroughs. If you get stuck, remember the [escalation process](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/cdda63c32f8121c67a2409ae64ddf572822da93e/pills/escalation_process.md) and reach out to your peers first, so that you can learn from each other.
