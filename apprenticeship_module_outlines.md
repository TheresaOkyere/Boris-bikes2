**Crucial Omissions:** There are some cross-cutting strands that we fit in alongside other work. These include wellbeing and code quality. They are not the topic of any one module, and you will miss them out unless you think of them regularly!

1. Navigate their essential programming environment
2. Fluently write procedural programs

### Mornings

These exercises can be used for independent study, or enhanced by group discussion.

The intention is that you should work through the core exercises in order, from the top to the bottom of the table, looking at optional exercises which interest you or which relate to key skills you feel you need more practice on.

Please **do not** proceed on to the next core exercise until you have validated the previous one by seeking feedback from a coach or another member of the cohort.

If you would prefer to work on a single, larger project, take a look at the [Gilded Rose Design Project](https://github.com/makersacademy/gilded_rose_design_project). This is more involved and a wider scope than the more targeted exercises listed above, and is likely to take up most of your mornings this week.
