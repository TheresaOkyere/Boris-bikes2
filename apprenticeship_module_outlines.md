### Exercises for self-directed learning

These exercises can be used for independent study, or enhanced by group discussion.

The intention is that you should work through the core exercises in order, from the top to the bottom of the table, looking at optional exercises which interest you or which relate to key skills you feel you need more practice on.

## Week 4: Object-Oriented Design

This week you're introduced to Object-Oriented Design (OOD).  OOD is one approach to organising your code into pieces that are easier to read, reason about, reuse and change.  As software engineers, we care deeply about these things because, when you're working in an engineering team, the one thing you can be certain about is that _your code base will change_.

### Reflect on TDD

The skills and concepts dealt with this week build on the things you learned last week, so take a moment to reflect on Test Driven Development. Maybe start by asking yourself "What did I learn about my progress from doing the Airport challenge?".

* Can you test-drive a class with instance variables and methods?
* Can you test-drive two classes that work together?

If you need to spend more time working on these things, now is the time!

### This module's goals

By the end of the module all developers can:
* Review another person's code and learn from what they read
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage

Stretch:
* Test classes in isolation using mocking and dependency injection
* Apply some basic OOP principles in tightly focussed exercises

#### The broader course goals relevant to this module are...

* I can write standards-compliant, clean object-oriented code
* I test-drive my code
* I can design a system

And you can remind yourself of the rest [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/apprenticeship_starting_pack/course_goals.md).

If you would prefer to work on a single, larger project, take a look at the [Gilded Rose Design Project](https://github.com/makersacademy/gilded_rose_design_project). This is more involved and a wider scope than the more targeted exercises listed above, and is likely to take up most of your mornings this week.
