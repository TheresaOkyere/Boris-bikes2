## Week 3: Test-Driven Development

### This module's main goals

By the end of the module all developers can:

* Gather evidence and use reflection to choose goals and track their progress
* Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
* Pair using the driver-navigator style
* Follow an effective debugging process

### Stretch goals

Not everyone will get onto these and that's OK – there will be plenty more time to work on them.

* Test drive a more complex application, with several classes that work together
* Use doubles and stubs to isloate your unit tests
* Use static code analysis tools to gain insight into the quality of your code


#### The broader course goals relevant to this module are...

* I test-drive my code
* I use a methodical approach to solving problems
* I use my own initiative

Remind yourself of the rest [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/apprenticeship_starting_pack/course_goals.md).

### Exercises for self-directed learning

These exercises can be used for independent study, or enhanced by group discussion.

For some skills, there are several options so that you can spend some time focussing on that one skill, if that's the best use of your time right now.  There is no expectation that you or anyone else will complete all the exercises.

If you're new to working with classes, start with *An intro to classes*.  If you've already used a class a few times, but not yet written any tests, start with *An intro to writing tests*.  If you've written a few tests already but would to get some more practice, start with *Test Driving a Dice Class*.  If you're looking for something more challenging, jump down to the stretch skills.

### Individual challenge

## Week 4: Object-Oriented Design

This week you're introduced to Object-Oriented Design (OOD).  OOD is one approach to organising your code into pieces that are easier to read, reason about, reuse and change.  As software engineers, we care deeply about these things because, when you're working in an engineering team, the one thing you can be certain about is that _your code base will change_.

### Reflect on TDD

The skills and concepts dealt with this week build on the things you learned last week, so take a moment to reflect on Test Driven Development. Maybe start by asking yourself "What did I learn about my progress from doing the Airport challenge?".

* Can you test-drive a class with instance variables and methods?
* Can you test-drive two classes that work together?

If you need to spend more time working on these things, now is the time!

### This module's main goals

By the end of the module all developers who focus on OOD this wee can:
* Review another person's code and learn from what they read
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage

Stretch:
* Test classes in isolation using mocking and dependency injection
* Apply some basic OOP principles in tightly focussed exercises

#### The broader course goals relevant to this module are...

* I can write standards-compliant, clean object-oriented code
* I test-drive my code
* I can design a system

And you can remind yourself of the rest [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/apprenticeship_starting_pack/course_goals.md).

* [POODR](https://www.poodr.com/), by Sandi Metz, is very highly regarded

### Exercises for self-directed learning

These exercises can be used for independent study, or enhanced by group discussion.

The intention is that you should work through the core exercises in order, from the top to the bottom of the table, looking at optional exercises which interest you or which relate to key skills you feel the need to practice.

If you would prefer to work on a single, larger project, take a look at the [Gilded Rose Design Project](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/individual_challenges/gilded_rose.md). This is more involved and a wider scope than the more targeted exercises listed above, and is likely to take up most of your mornings this week.

### Pairing challenge

[Oystercard](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/oystercard)

### Individual challenge options

This week you can choose your challenge...

* [Apply your new knowledge to the Airport challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/airport_challenge)<br>
* [Do the office management challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/office-management-challenge) or [the takeaway challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/takeaway-challenge) if you want to try something new.


## Week 5: The Web

### This module's main goals
By the end of the week, all developers can:
* Write feature tests using Capybara
* Test-drive a simple Sinatra app
* Follow an effective process to debug web applications
* Explain and diagram the HTTP request/response cycle
* Explain and diagram the MVC pattern

#### Stretch goals

If you complete the above, try to:
* Explain what is meant by 'deploy'
* Deploy a simple Sinatra app (for example, Hello, World) using the free tier on Heroku

These really are stretch goals.  We've not created any exercises for them, so part of the challenge is research based.  There's a lot of guidance on deploying sinatra applications to Heroku.  [This is a good place to start](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rack#pure-rack-apps).

#### The broader course goals relevent to this module are...

* I can design and build user interfaces
* I test-drive my code

And you can remind yourself of the rest [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/apprenticeship_starting_pack/course_goals.md).

### Resources

* [How the web works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works) – you'll probably get asked about this in a job interview one day ;)

### Exercises for self-directed learning

These exercises can be used for independent study, or enhanced by group discussion.  They will help you work towards this week's goals.  If you find that these tasks contain a lot of code that confuses you, you might be better off doing some exercises from a previous week to cement that learning.  If you're not sure what to do, reach out to a coach right now!  Don't hesitate :)

> WATCH OUT, REMOTE WORKERS!!  Some of these exercises ask you to collaborate with another learner and send messages from your machine to theirs. This will not work as described unless you're on the same network, so you won't be able to do those few parts whilst working remotely.

## Week 6: Databases

This week, you'll learn how to build database-backed web applications.  Along the way, you'll build your own [Object Relational Mapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataMapper). Bear in mind that you'll probably never have to do this again – you'd use an existing tool like [Active Record](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activerecord) or [Ruby Object Mapper](https://rom-rb.org/) instead – but building your own tools is a great way to learn how tools of that type work.

### This module's main goals

By the end of the module all developers can:

* Explain the data flow from user action to server resource and back again
* Explain the basics of how databases work, including:
   - What tables are and how they are structured
   - What structured query language (SQL) is used for
   - One to one relationships
   - One to many relationships
   - Many to many relationships
* Follow an effective debugging process for database-backed web applications
* Build a simple web app that can read from and write to a database

#### Stretch goals

If you have completed all of the above goals, you can move on to these.

* Deploy an application to Heroku
* Explain the difference between Postgres and MongoDB
* Swap postgres DB for MongoDB in one of your existing applications

#### The broader course goals relevent to this module are...

* I can integrate a database
* I can design a system

And you can remind yourself of the rest [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/apprenticeship_starting_pack/course_goals.md).

## Week 7: MakersBnB

During this week, you'll work in teams to [build a program according to a specification][makersbnb].  Technically, a lot of what you do will be a recap of the preceeding weeks.

### This module's main goals

By the end of this module all developers can:

* Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
* Build to a specification (rather than challenges)
* Run stand-ups and retrospectives
* Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
* Give and receive meaningful code review

### Your schedule

Some team meetings have been added to your schedule already:

1. Team standups, where you'll quickly check in with each other and communicate your plans for the day.  Keep them brief. If you need time to discuss things in more detail, add specific meetings to your agenda for that.
2. Team stand downs, where you'll quickly refelct on how your day has gone.  Again keep them brief.
4. Sprint planning, where you'll aim to plan what work your team will take on in the next sprint.
5. Sprint review, where you look back on the work done in the current sprint. If you had clients, they'd be in the room for this one.
5. Sprint retrospectives, where you'll seek answers to the question "how can we be a better team?".  You'll think about what you did well, what could be improved and what actions you'll take to realise those improvements.

You might consider adding these to your shedule:

1. Independent learning.  Make sure you strictly time box this and always include time for sharing what has been learned.  I'd recommend that you keep these to 45 mins plus 15 mins for sharing.
2. Mobbing.  This is where you all 'gather around' one machine and write code together. It can be useful to have 3+ brains and pairs of eyes on a problem but these sessions can become tiresome.  Again, you should strictly time box these sessions.  You should also watch out for signs of disengagement – if you see them, it's time to mix things up.

### Why so many meetings??

For some of you, this will seem like overkill and you'll want to 'just get cracking', or something like that.  These meetings, however, are designed to ensure that by the time you do get cracking, you are happier and more productive.

1 hour spent working on a really well understood task, pulling in the right direction, is worth infinitely more than 2 hours working on a poorly defined task, creating something that doesn't meet the specifications.

### Who will facilitate your meetings?

On placement, you'll work in multidisciplinary teams, with people like Deliver Mangers and Product Managers, who provide vision and support.  This week, you'll do a lot of these things for yourselves.  I'd recommend that each day you nominate someone to faciliate team meetings.  Ideally, everyone in the team has at least one day in this role.

As facilitator, your most important job is to create and maintain an friendly space so that everyone in the team feels comfortable contributing.  You might occasionally need to take a step back in order to do this well.

### What are the hallmarks of a great team?

How many of these can you tick off?

   [ ] We all understand every ticket in the backlog\
   [ ] We do not have to ask for clarity on tickets in the middle of a sprint\
   [ ] All of our code is peer reviewed\
   [ ] We are sharing knowledge within the team\
   [ ] We all feel comfortable speaking openly in team retrospectives

What would you add to the list?

## Week 8: Learn A New Language

In this module you'll focus on developing a great process for learning a new language.  From time to time you should ask yourself this question: what would my plan be if I were to start learning another new language tomorrow?  You might find that your answer to this question changes during the week.

If you already know some Javascript, please keep an open mind and pay close attention to how the week is structured. If you can do this really well, you'll come away with some insights into how to learn new programming languages.

### This module's main goals

By the end of the module all developers can:

* Describe a process for learning a new language
* Follow an effective process for learning a new language
* Compare and contrast Javascript and Ruby
* Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript

#### The broader course goals relevent to this module are...

* I can design and build user interfaces
* I test-drive my code
* I use my own initiative

### Exercises for self-directed learning

These exercises can be used for independent study, or enhanced by group discussion.

### Individual challenge

For this module there are several options.  You should take a moment to decide which is the right one for you before getting started.  If you choose something and regret it, go back and choose something else! :)

* Create a JS app that fulfills the [Office Management Challenge user stories](https://github.com/makersacademy/office-management-challenge#task)
   - A familiar problem in a new language
   - Do this one if you would like to focus on basic Javascript syntax
   - You can either create a new repo or fork/clone this one and remove all the Ruby
   - STRETCH: Can you extend the challenge to include a simple user interface?
* Create a JS app that fullfills the [Takeaway Challenge user stories](https://github.com/makersacademy/takeaway-challenge#task)
   - Towards the end of the Takeaway challenge, you'll have fun sending text messages with the Twilion API! :)
   - Do this one if you want something a little bit more challenging
   - You can either create a new repo or fork/clone this one and remove all the Ruby
   - STRETCH: Can you extend the challenge to include a simple user interface?
* A basic implementation of [the bowling challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/bowling-challenge)
   - The bowling challenge is designed to be done over 4 days
   - You won't finish it in 1 and you'll need to be OK with that
   - Do this one if you want to try something very challenging :)


## Weeks 9 & 10: Engineering Project I

By the end of the module all developers can:
