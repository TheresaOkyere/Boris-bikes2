### Exercises for self-directed learning

These exercises can be used for independent study, or enhanced by group discussion.

The intention is that you should work through the core exercises in order, from the top to the bottom of the table, looking at optional exercises which interest you or which relate to key skills you feel you need more practice on.

Please **do not** proceed on to the next core exercise until you have validated the previous one by seeking feedback from a coach or another member of the cohort.

If you would prefer to work on a single, larger project, take a look at the [Gilded Rose Design Project](https://github.com/makersacademy/gilded_rose_design_project). This is more involved and a wider scope than the more targeted exercises listed above, and is likely to take up most of your mornings this week.
