**Crucial Omissions:** There are some cross-cutting strands that we fit in alongside other work. These include wellbeing and code quality. They are not the topic of any one module, and you will miss them out unless you think of them regularly!

* Navigate their essential programming environment (Module 1)
* Fluently write procedural programs (Module 2)

### Challenges

### Practicals

These can be used for independent study, or enhanced by group discussion.

Each of the exercises in the table below will link you to a Diode project with further details. The intention is that you should work through the core exercises in order, from the top to the bottom of the table, looking at optional exercises which interest you or which relate to key skills you feel you need more practice on.

Please **do not** proceed on to the next core exercise until you have validated the previous one in Diode and, ideally, have received feedback from a coach.
