**Crucial Omissions:** There are some cross-cutting strands that we fit in alongside other work. This includes code quality. They are not the topic of any one week, and you will miss them out unless you think of them regularly!

**Remember: [Success at Makers](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/goals)** means understanding how to [reflect on your learning](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/goals/reflective_learning.md) throughout these three months in order to demonstrate to yourself you've achieved the course goals.

## Week 1

### Goals

By the end of the week all developers can:

* Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
* Pair using the driver-navigator style
* Follow an effective debugging process
* Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

#### Wider course goals this week should help with (see all [course goals here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/goals/course_goals.md))

<dl>
  <dt>I can TDD anything</dt>
  <dd>By the end of this week you should be able to write a meaningful test, based on the user requirements. You'll then be able to write code using TDD, to make the test pass.</dd>
  <dt>I can program fluently</dt>
  <dd>You'll learn how to setup and structure a new Ruby project, and turn user requirements into working code.</dd>
  <dt>I can debug anything</dt>
  <dd>You'll be introduced to a technique for uncovering the root-cause of bugs in your code. When your code doesn't work, you'll be able to apply a consistent process to resolve the issue.</dd>
</dl>

## Week 2

By the end of the week all developers can:

* Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
* Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

You may notice you are completing the work quicker and with more ease than your peers. If this sounds like you, it's important to speak to a coach as they can provide additional challenge for you to make sure you continue to progress.

Start attending [process workshops](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/process_review) to focus on your developer process. Anyone from any cohort ever can attend.

Watch a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqKG8j_tgbM) explaining what Reviews are and how to use this valuable resource - and then consider booking one!
