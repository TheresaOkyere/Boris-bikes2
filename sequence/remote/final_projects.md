## Schedule

There will be almost no structure for the next two weeks.  It will be down to you to organise your days, your standups and your retros.

### Week 11

#### Monday to Friday

Project work.

### Week 12

#### Wednesday

* Evening: :snowflake: :snowflake: Feature freeze :snowflake: :snowflake: You stop building new features.  You'll spend the rest of the time refactoring to make your code as well-crafted as you can.  You'll also spend time working on your presentation.

#### Thursday

* Practice presentations. This will be a session where you can practice your presentations and get feedback from your coach.  You can drop in and out - you don't all have to be here.

#### Friday

* Morning: You'll have a technical run-through with your coach to make sure slides, videos & audio are presentable as expected.
* Afternoon: You'll take part in a 30 minute project fair. We'll compile a spreadsheet to share amongst Makers with a link to your individual team Zoom calls alongside a description of your project. Makers can pop in to see a demo of your project and ask questions. 

##### Demo day ceremony

* 5.10pm: Opening spiel from coach.
* 5.20pm: First team presents.
* 6.10pm: Closing spiel from coach.
