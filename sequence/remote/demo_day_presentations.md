# Important instructions for Remote Demo Day Presentations

* Please make your presentations using a tool that **allows your team to edit at the same time**. For example:
    * [beautiful.ai](https://www.beautiful.ai)
    * [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/)
    * [slides.com](https://slides.com)

* One member of your team will share screen and run the presentation. Please plan how the person sharing the presentation will go on to the next slide.

* As a fallback, each member of your team should have a copy of the slide deck, your presentation, and demo video downloaded onto your computer in case someone's Internet disconnects. Designate a back-up screen-sharer. 

* By Friday afternoon, please send your coach:
  * A link to your slides
  * A link to your demo video
