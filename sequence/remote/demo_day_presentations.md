# Important instructions for Onsite Demo Day Presentations

* Please make your presentations using a tool that **allows your team to edit at the same time**. For example:
    * [beautiful.ai](https://www.beautiful.ai)
    * [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/)
    * [slides.com](https://slides.com)

* One of your team will share screen and run the presentation. Please plan how the person sharing the presentation will go on to the next slide.

* As a fallback your coach will have all your slides ready, so that they could share their screen if there are issues during the presentations.

* By Friday afternoon, please send your coach:
  * A link to your slides
  * A link to your demo video  (This way I can have it downloaded on my machine in case the internet dies.)
