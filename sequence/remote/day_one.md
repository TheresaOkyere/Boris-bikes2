# Your first day at Makers

Day one starts with an informal social - this will also be a good opportunity to make sure you are set-up correctly to join zoom meetings and debug anything that comes up before the actual start. Grab a coffee, bring your breakfast, and say hi!

Look out for a zoom link in your cohort channel on slack!
