## Checklist for your first day (and beyond)

Make sure you've read the [student manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G3am9kQzBFBerZjCR6WlinJb3YfgOpx486VFCH3R8DI/edit?usp=sharing) - remember before coming to the office:

 * Make sure you've got a negative lateral flow test result (you'll need to show the text or email)
 * Install the NHS COVID app
 * Wear a mask inside the building and on public transport
 * Bring your laptop and charger - or pick it here on your first day (take it home with you when leaving the building) if you're borrowing one from us
 * Bring earphones or headphones for sessions where you'll need to dial-in on Zoom

## Schedule for the first day

If you arrive early please wait in the 2nd Floor Kitchen. Please bring your breakfast in case you don't have it at home. Your coach will arrive around that time. Please ask them any questions you have about the course.
