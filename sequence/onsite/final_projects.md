## Schedule

There will be almost no structure for the next two weeks.  It will be down to you to organise your days, your standups and your retros.

### Week 11

#### Monday to Friday

* Project work.

### Week 12

#### Wednesday

* Evening: :snowflake: :snowflake: Feature freeze :snowflake: :snowflake: You stop building new features.  You'll spend the rest of the time refactoring to make your code as well-crafted as you can.  You'll also spend time working on your presentation.

#### Thursday

* 3.30pm - 4.50pm: Practice presentations. This will be a session where you can practice your presentations and get feedback from your coach.  You can drop in and out - you don't all have to be here.

##### Friday: Demo day
