# How to self-assess after attempting the End of Unit Challenge

<br>

  Adapting to self-led learning is a journey and it's important to reflect and check-in with yourself. This will help you iterate on where you should focus your attention and how to plan your learning.

  Makers often find it difficult to know how "well" their attempt at the week's end of unit work went so here is a guide to support you with this.


--------

<br>

###   Here are some questions to ask yourself after you have finished working on the End of Unit work:


* **Did you test drive and implement the code for at least half of the user stories?**

* **Did you write tests for all of the methods you wrote?**

* **Did you write most of the code independently without having to rely heavily on videos or other examples of this end of unit work?**

  If you answered **<em>"yes"</em>** to the above questions it sounds like you made some really great progress! You can still follow the steps below if you'd like to continue improving on these vital dev processes.

  If you answered **<em>"no"</em>** to 1 or more of these questions, it’s likely there are coding processes you need more practice with and that is common.

  We recommend that you find 45 minutes (15 minutes one day for your plan and 30 minutes another day for the exercise) during the coming week to do the following steps from 1 - 6 below:

####   What you should do next to make sure you can improve on with coding processes:


1. Reach out to a coach about what you found blocked you at the weekend so you can both discuss what you could have done differently and to determine if there are some specific processes that you can focus on.


2. Watch [this planning video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z-ez0kmoRRxYX_FHhieJjYS33xJ6MYLy/view?usp=sharing).

   **After** watching the video, spend 15 minutes maximum creating a plan for [this Leap Year process workshop exercise](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/main/process_review/exercises/leap_years), you should use the acceptance criteria from the Leap Year exercise to help guide you.


3. Send this plan to a coach for review.


4. Once the coach has given the green light for your plan, attempt the exercise with TDD and record your screen as per the instructions [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/main/process_review): (you can do the exercise without a pair partner watching for now).


5. Get feedback on your exercise video from a coach.


6. Depending on the feedback either re-attempt the exercise or move onto the next one on the process workshop list [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/main/process_review). Repeat steps 2 - 6 until you feel like you're progressing as you'd like with the end of unit work.


7. **If you've tried steps 1 - 6 and are still getting blocked, reach out again to a coach. We always like to hear from you and are here to help.**
